While Erii rekindles with Banri, who is undergoing physiotherapy, Mikoto tries to come up with a way to surprise Banri with a present everyone bought for her, only to realize she had left the bag containing the present in Banri's ward. Just then, a criminal patient that was under watch by the Anti-Skills is broken free by some of his companions and takes Erii as a hostage. Upon learning of the situation from Aiho Yomikawa and Tsuzuri Tessō, Mikoto heads to the rooftop to try and prevent the culprits escaping via helicopter. They throw Erii off the side of the building in order to break free, but she is saved thanks to Ruiko and Kuroko. Learning that her bag is onboard the fleeing helicopter, Mikoto has Kuroko teleport her to the skies where she destroys the helicopter with her railgun, with Kuroko safely apprehending the culprits. With the incident dealt with, Banri finally opens her present from everyone, which is a Sakugawa Middle School uniform for her to wear once she recovers. \n\n\n2 (26)\n\"Critical\"\n\"Kuritikaru\" (寿命中断（クリティカル）) \nApril 19, 2013\n\n\nMikoto recalls in a dream of how, when she was younger, she was approached by scientists wanting to use her DNA map to help cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The next morning, Kuroko tries to take Mikoto through an alleyway to get to the mall, but they encounter a few people passing by. They discover this is due to someone hiding envelopes containing cash cards within the alleyways, piquing people's curiosity to search for them. After running into Ruiko, who is also on the hunt for the money cards, Mikoto overhears some Skill-Outs who have managed to locate the source of the envelopes and decides to follow them. Meanwhile, Ruiko grows curious as she had allegedly seen Mikoto at the mall, despite Mikoto never actually getting there, with Mii Konori explaining to Kazari about a rumor of there being clones of a Level 5 esper. The Skill-Outs eventually trace the envelopes back to a Nagatenjōki Academy student, demanding she hand over the other envelopes. Things get tense, however, when it appears the Skill-Outs are gradually getting killed off by the girl, who claims to be able to freely kill anyone she has touched. When Mikoto arrives on the scene, the girl, who had simply knocked out all the Skill-Outs using anesthetic and clever acting skills, recognizes her as the \"original\". \n\n\n3 (27)\n\"Project Radio Noise\"\n\"Redio Noizu Keikaku\" (超電磁砲量産計画（レディオノイズけいかく）) \nApril 26, 2013\n\n\nMikoto is reminded of rumors about there being a clone of her and attempts to question the girl, who was distributing the envelopes in order to fill the alleyways that security cameras cannot reach with human eyes. However, the girl leaves after inadvertently setting the building on fire whilst burning the evidence, simply stating Mikoto is better off not knowing as she would be unable to stop what was happening with her power. After saving the Skill-Outs, Mikoto looks up for information on the girl, whose name is revealed to be Shinobu Nunotaba, who actually worked at the same medical facility where she had given the scientists her DNA map years ago. Mikoto infiltrates the facility and comes across a room that is separate from the rest of the building's network. Mikoto hacks into database there and is shocked to learn that the scientists tricked her into giving them her DNA map in order to create clones called \"Sisters\", known as Project Radio Noise. However, the project was cancelled when the supercomputer, Tree Diagram, deduced that the clones would not come close to matching Mikoto's level of power. Believing there were not any clones of her after all, Mikoto feels relieved and leaves the facility, unaware of a clone arriving later to delete the database. \n\n\n4 (28)\n\"Sisters\"\n\"Shisutāzu\" (妹達（シスターズ）) \nMay 3, 2013\n\n\nThree months earlier, in an unknown facility, a pair of women scientists, later recognized as Yumi Kusakabe and Eiga Kanmi, had mentored the birth of a clone of Mikoto, labelled Misaka 9982, installing memory functions via a capsule-like machine called Testament. Back in the present, Mikoto, who is feeling cheerful with the clone rumors being seemingly debunked, goes shopping with Kuroko and the others at the mall, helping Kazari and Erii buy a rice cooker whilst also picking out things for an upcoming school trip. The next day, as Mikoto ends up having nothing to do, some young children, including the girl whose bag she previously found, pick up on her boredom and have her play with them. Noticing one of the kids wearing a Gekota badge, Mikoto frantically goes through a whole bunch of capsule vendors in order to win one for herself. As the day comes to an end, Mikoto suddenly senses a power identical to her own and, upon chasing after its source, comes across Misaka 9982. \n\n\n5 (29)\n\"Project Level 6 Shift\"\n\"Reberu Shikkusu Shifuto Keikaku\" (絶対能力進化計画（レベル6 シフト けいかく）) \nMay 10, 2013\n\n\nAfter unwillingly helping her rescue a kitten from a tree, Mikoto tries to question Misaka 9982, but is unable to learn much due to being unable to decipher a codeword. She instead decides to follow her around in case she returns to her base of operations, where they end up doing some surprisingly sisterly activities. Later that evening, as Misaka 9982 points out that she is not returning to her point of origin, Mikoto takes her leave after inadvertently giving her the Gekota badge she won earlier. After receiving some help from Kazari in deciphering the codeword she was told about, Mikoto is horrified to learn of Project Level 6 Shift, in which 20,000 Sisters from Project Radio Noise are to be killed in 20,000 battles in order to evolve Academy City's most powerful Level 5 esper, Accelerator, into a Level 6 esper. Whilst learning of this, Misaka 9982 engages in her assigned battle with the aforementioned Accelerator, finding herself helpless against his reflective abilities. Fleeing to a railway yard, she attempts a sneak attack on Accelerator using a planted mine, only for him to survive and tear off her leg. Mikoto arrives on the scene, only to look in horror as Accelerator crushes Misaka 9982 to death with a train, sending Mikoto into a furious rage. \n\n\n6 (30)\n\"I... Can See All of You\"\n\"Atashi... Minna no Koto Miete Irukara\" (あたし…みんなのこと見えているから) \nMay 17, 2013\n\n\nMikoto unleashes her anger at Accelerator, who quickly deduces she is the original, and becomes further enraged upon seeing Misaka 9982's torn leg and hearing Accelerator's selfish reasons for participating in the experiment. However, even her most powerful attacks are simply reflected back at her. Just then, the fight is halted by the arrival of dozens of other Sisters, who request that Accelerator stop fighting Mikoto to avoid throwing off the experiment's calculations. As Accelerator takes his leave, Mikoto feels no comfort in hearing the Sisters acknowledge themselves as nothing more than guinea pigs. After a restless night, Mikoto is approached by Shinobu, who explains why she chose to oppose the experiment. Having been called back from Project Radio Noise to assist in Project Level 6 Shift, Shinobu got to see the sensitive side of one of the Sisters and became unable to see them as anything other than human. Upon hearing this, Mikoto takes it upon herself to destroy the facilities involved in the experiment, keeping it a secret from Kuroko and the others. \n\n\n7 (31)\n\"I... I Want To Be of Help To You, Sissy\"\n\"Onee-sama no Chikara ni Naritai desu no\" (お姉さまの力になりたいですの) \nMay 24, 2013\n\n\nEliminating as many facilities involved with Project Level 6 Shift through electronic warfare before she is shut out from their communication lines, Mikoto starts spending several nights attacking the other facilities directly. Kuroko, who has grown concerned about Mikoto constantly being out at night, comes across a group of girls who are looking for a \"lucky card\", based on an urban legend spawned from the cash card incident. The next day, Kuroko encounters one of the girls, Minori, saving her from being hit by a car during her search, hearing how she wanted to find a lucky item for her friend who is moving away. After pointing out cash cards would be out of the question, since they would need to be turned into Judgment, Konori suggests that they instead search for a four-leaf clover. During their search, Kazari and Ruiko give Kuroko some assurance that Mikoto, along with themselves, appreciate her efforts. Both Kuroko and Minori find four-leaved clovers, with Kuroko keeping hers and resolving to always wait for Mikoto. Meanwhile, as Mikoto manages to dwindle down the remaining facilities to two, Kites Knockraven, a higher up in the project, prepare a counter-plan. \n\n\n8 (32)\n\"ITEM\"\n\"Aitemu\" (ITEM（アイテム）) \nMay 31, 2013\n\n\nWith only two facilities remaining, Knockraven calls upon the services of the mercenary team ITEM. As Mikoto infiltrates one of these facilities, she finds herself against one of its members, Frenda Seivelun, who causes trouble for her using flammable tape and stuffed dolls containing bombs. Meanwhile, Shinobu arrives at the other remaining facility, where they are attempting to transport the data whilst the other facility is being attacked. Mikoto chases down Frenda who, after a series of failed attacks, fills the room up with nitrogen, bluffing that it is an explosive gas to prevent Mikoto from using her electricity against her. However, Mikoto, refusing to simply give up and be killed, manages to fight back against Frenda, leading to her bluff becoming exposed. As Mikoto tries to interrogate Frenda, who is unable to respond due to being shocked by her, she is suddenly attacked by ITEM's leader and the fourth ranked Level 5 esper, Shizuri Mugino. \n\n\n9 (33)\n\"AIM Stalker\"\n\"Ei Ai Emu Sutōkā\" (能力追迹（AIMストーカー）) \nJune 7, 2013\n\n\nMikoto attempts to escape from Shizuri's attacks, which proves difficult due to ITEM's third member, Rikō Takitsubo, using her AIM Stalker ability to help Shizuri and Frenda home their attacks on her position. Meanwhile, Shinobu, who felt Mikoto should not have to carry her burden alone, sneaks into the basement of her facility where the incubated Sisters are being held, hoping to install emotions into all of the remaining Sisters via the Misaka Network in the hopes that it may move the organizers to suspend the experiments. However, she is apprehended by ITEM's fourth member, Saiai Kinuhata, who was guarding the facility in case a second party was involved in the attacks. Shinobu manages to get the program installing, but it is suddenly blocked by an unforeseen error code. Shinobu fires a gun at Saiai to save herself, but her attack fails due to Saiai's Offense Armor ability and she is taken into custody. Back at the other facility, a weakened Mikoto is forced to use her ability to deflect Shizuri's Meltdowner attack, making her realize who the intruder's identity is. Learning of this, Shizuri decides to send the injured Frenda and exhausted Rikō away so she can settle things with Mikoto herself. \n\n\n10 (34)\n\"Meltdowner\"\n\"Merutodaunā\" (原子崩し（メルトダウナー）) \nJune 14, 2013\n\n\nComing face to face with Shizuri, Mikoto uses some of the explosive dolls that Frenda inadvertently left behind to compensate for her weakened powers. Shizuri fights off these dolls by using silicon shards cards to divide her lasers, but Mikoto manages to knock her out with one of the remaining dolls. After finding and destroying the facility's data bank, Mikoto finds herself on the run from an angered Shizuri. Fleeing to a bridge, Mikoto manages to get the best of Shizuri by using Frenda's flammable tape to collapse the walkway underneath her and cause her to fall down. As Mikoto makes her escape, Shizuri manages to learn about Project Level 6 Shift from one of the staff and decides it would be more amusing to let Mikoto suffer. The next day, Mikoto investigates the remaining facility, only to find it completely abandoned, allegedly having gone bankrupt. Believing the experiments to finally be over, Mikoto comes across Tōma Kamijō by the vending machines. \n\n\n11 (35)\n\"The Vending Machine\"\n\"Jidō Hanbaiki\" (自動販売機) \nJune 21, 2013\n\n\nMikoto runs into Tōma, who appears to have trouble remembering who she is, and vandalizes a vending machine to spit out drinks to compensate for some money it had stolen from him. Kuroko arrives on the scene and, despite not being pleased over the presence of a supposed \"boyfriend\", feels relieved that Mikoto appears to be back to her cheerful self and takes her leave. However, Mikoto's joy is short-lived when another Sister, Misaka 10031, appears before her, telling her in private that the experiments are still ongoing. Horrified to learn more Sisters have died because of her, Mikoto ends up yelling at Misaka 10031 for reminding her of Misaka 9982. Later discovering that countless other facilities have picked up the experiment, Mikoto comes to realize that her enemy is Academy City itself. Meanwhile, Accelerator recalls how he was first approached about Project Level 6 Shift. Deciding that she will need to do something drastic in order to stop the experiments, Mikoto feels relieved that Kuroko would still perform her duty as a Judgment officer should she be labelled a criminal for doing so. \n\n\n12 (36)\n\"Tree Diagram\"\n\"Tsurī Daiaguramu\" (樹形図の設計者（ツリーダイアグラム）) \nJune 28, 2013\n\n\nMikoto resolves to hack into and destroy the Tree Diagram, the supercomputer responsible for the experiment's calculations, in the hope she may be able to stop them. Meanwhile, Tōma encounters Misaka 10032, who coerces him into helping her look after an abandoned kitten she had found. As Tōma goes into a bookstore to look for a book to help him with his own cat, Misaka 10032 goes off to observe Accelerator as he begins his scheduled battle with Misaka 10031. Arriving at Tree Diagram's control center, hoping to hack into Tree Diagram to order a halt to the experiment, Mikoto is confused to find it not only heavily low on security, but completely abandoned as well. Hacking into the system, she is horrified to learn the truth, in that Tree Diagram had been destroyed for months, with the experiments continuing regardless. \n\n\n13 (37)\n\"Accelerator\"\n\"Akuserarēta\" (一方通行（アクセラレータ）) \nJuly 5, 2013\n\n\nMikoto falls in despair, realizing that with Tree Diagram destroyed, she has no way of stopping the experiments. She tries to cling onto her cause by mercilessly destroying another facility, but loses all hope when she sees a live feed of Misaka 10031 being killed by Accelerator. As Accelerator reminisces about his first experiment and his first time killing a Sister, Tōma discovers Misaka 10031's corpse and calls the Anti-Skills to investigate it, only to find it gone when they arrive, with no evidence it ever occurred. After the Anti-Skills leave, Misaka 10032 appears before Tōma, who comes to learn the true nature of the Sisters. Upon learning this, Tōma heads for the Tokiwadai dorms to try to get some answers from Mikoto, who at the same time is contemplating her last resort. \n\n\n14 (38)\n\"The Promise\"\n\"Yakusoku\" (約束) \nJuly 12, 2013\n\n\nTōma arrives at the Tokiwadai dorms, where he is reluctantly greeted by Kuroko, who decides to let him wait for Mikoto return. When the Tokiwadai Dorm Supervisor comes by for an inspection, Kuroko is forced to hide Tōma under Mikoto's bed due to his Imagine Breaker negating her teleportation. There, he finds the details concerning Project Level 6 Shift stuffed inside a teddy bear, learning that Misaka 10032's experiment is next. Tōma follows a trail of windmills to a bridge where he eventually finds Mikoto and confronts her about the experiments. With all her other efforts failed, Mikoto feels convinced that letting herself be killed by Accelerator is the only way to stop the experiments, proving she does not live up to Tree Diagram's expectations. However, Tōma, feeling her way will not save anyone, decides to stand in her way, refusing to fight back or even defend himself from Mikoto's lightning. Mikoto's emotions soon build up into a large shock wave that Tōma takes the full brunt of, helping her to see his resolve. After regaining consciousnesses and being greeted by a tearful Mikoto, Tōma comes up with the idea that if he as a Level 0 can defeat the Level 5 Accelerator in a fight and prove him to be actually weak, the entire basis for the experiments would fall apart. Despite Mikoto's objection, Tōma heads off to where Misaka 10032's experiment is being held. \n\n\n15 (39)\n\"Tōma Kamijō\"\n\"Kamijō Tōma\" (最弱（かみじょうとうま）) \nJuly 19, 2013\n\n\nDespite his injuries, Tōma arrives at the site where Accelerator and Misaka 10032 are fighting and states his firm desire to rescue the Sister, saying that even if she is a clone, there is only one of her in the entire world. As their fight begins, Tōma initially struggles against Accelerator as he launches projectiles at him and sets off a dust explosion. However, Accelerator is shocked when Tōma is able to punch him with his right hand without being affected by his ability, also coming as a surprise to Mikoto, who had also rushed to the scene. Angered, Accelerator starts using his ability to manipulate the wind, creating a huge hurricane that deals a lot of damage to Tōma. Mikoto attempts to go with her original plan in order to save Tōma, only to realize it would be futile upon witnessing Accelerator using his power to create a plasma storm that would wipe out everything in the area. Realizing what can be done to stop it, Mikoto goes over to Misaka 10032 and begs for her help in protecting Tōma's dream. Moved by these words, Misaka 10032 uses the Misaka Network to command the other Sisters in Academy City to manipulate the city's windmills with their electricity, affecting the wind and disrupting Accelerator's calculations, preventing him from stabilizing the plasma. As Mikoto prepares to stand off against Accelerator once more, Tōma gathers the strength to stand up. \n\n\n16 (40)\n\"Sisterhood\"\n\"Shimai\" (姉妹) \nJuly 26, 2013\n\n\nAccelerator demands to know why Mikoto is protecting Misaka 10032, to which she responds that it is simply because she is her sister. Before Accelerator can attempt to kill them, Tōma manages to regain his footing and uses the remainder of his strength to knock Accelerator out with one final punch. As he loses consciousness, Accelerator comes to the realization that the reason he wanted to become a Level 6 in the first place was so that he would not have to hurt anyone anymore. After the experiments are cancelled as a result of Accelerator's defeat, Mikoto goes to the hospital to visit Tōma, who assures her that even though many Sisters died, it was thanks to her that they got to be born in the first place. Afterwards, Mikoto takes a walk with Misaka 10032, where they play with another pair of sisters at the playground and think about the future that lies ahead. The next day, Mikoto borrows Ruiko's kitchen to make some handmade cookies for Tōma as thanks for his help. Despite not getting an opportunity to give them to him, Mikoto feels pleased when he finally calls her by her proper name. \n\n\n17 (41)\n\"Study Group\"\n\"Benkyō-kai\" (勉強会) \nAugust 2, 2013\n\n\nWhen asked by the Dorm Supervisor to explain her absences, Mikoto bluffs that she was having study sessions with her friends. As Ruiko arranges a get together so she can hear who Mikoto was making cookies for the other day, Kuroko comes across Minori again before being dragged along by Mitsuko Kongō to a pet shop. Meanwhile, Mikoto visits Heaven Canceller to hear about the status of the Sisters, learning they are being reconfigured so they may live longer than their originally intended two year lifespan. As Mikoto and Kuroko meet up at a family restaurant, they come across Shizuri and Frenda, leading to an awkward argument between Kuroko and Frenda over their respective partners, which is inevitably followed by an explosive punishment. After having a nabe party with everyone, Kuroko is relieved to see Mikoto back to her usual self. \n\n\n18 (42)\n\"Moving\"\n\"O Hikkoshi\" (お引越し) \nAugust 16, 2013[7]\n\n\nA mysterious organization oversees ITEM as they fight against a group of mechs. The next day, Mikoto and the gang visit Banri, who is due to be discharged from the hospital soon and will be moving into an apartment with Erii, who will be moving out of Kazari's apartment as a result. As the gang discuss about the move, Kuroko and Kazari reveals Judgement will be on duty for the upcoming Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly, where Academy City's top genius students will attend. Meanwhile, Mitsuko uses her power to stop a purse thief, only to be berated by a certain man for her actions. As the group gets together to celebrate Banri's dischargement, Kuroko and Kazari are called off for Judgment duties when the city's traffic signals suddenly go out. After finishing her duties, Kazari gives a box of taiyaki to Erii, serving as a memento of when she first told Erii about her ability of temperature preservation, and the two have a tearful farewell as roommates. As the group take a detour home, they come across a curious white-haired girl named Febri, who appears to know Mikoto. Meanwhile, the mysterious organization begins their next plan to show their power against espers. \n\n\n19 (43)\n\"Academic Research Assembly\"\n\"Gakuentoshi Kenkyū Happyōkai\" (学園都市研究発表会) \nAugust 23, 2013\n\n\nThe girls are unable to find out any more information from Febri, who appears to be a bit cautious around Mikoto and takes a liking with Ruiko. After Febri spends a night with Ruiko at Kazari's apartment, the group, believing Febri to be a Child Error, make arrangements for her to be moved to the orphanage in Asunaro Park in a week. As the gang heads to where the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly will be held, Ruiko sets up some time for Mikoto to get along with Febri on their own. When Febri wanders off while Mikoto is not looking, the man from before spots her and sends some security bots after her. Luckily, Mikoto manages to rescue Febri, who apologizes for making her worry and comes to accept her. With Mikoto now involved, the man and his colleagues decide to include her in their experiments. \n\n\n20 (44)\n\"Febri\"\n\"Feburi\" (フェブリ) \nAugust 30, 2013\n\n\nAs Yomikawa becomes curious over how the security bots functioned without any batteries, Konori treats Mikoto and the others by taking them to the public baths, where Mikoto lets Febri keep her rare pink Gekota finger puppet from her collection. Whilst heading home, the girls are led on a detour to a warehouse, where they are attacked by a mech. As Mikoto fights against the mech, which seems resiliant to her electricity, the mech suddenly stops functioning when it comes close to attacking Febri, allowing Mitsuko to defeat it with her Aero Hand ability. After Mikoto discovers the mech to be curiously unmanned, Febri comes down with a fever and is admitted into the hospital. Meanwhile, it is shown that Shinobu is working with the group targeting Febri. Back at the hospital, Mitsuko informs the others about how she, Kinuho Wannai and Maaya Awatsuki came to learn that the man from before was attempting to \"reclaim\" Febri. The next morning as Febri seems to make a full recovery, Heaven Canceller informs Mikoto in private that Febri is in fact an artificial human. \n\n\n21 (45)\n\"Darkness\"\n\"Yami\" (闇) \nSeptember 6, 2013\n\n\nHeaven Canceller goes on to explain to Mikoto that Febri's body secretes a poison, requiring her to suck special lollipops to neutralize it, leaving her angry that another dark organization is performing twisted experiments. Whilst keeping this a secret from the others, Mikoto runs into Misaka 10032 who, having visited Febri the previous night, informs her that Febri had been wanting to meet her own big sister. She also reveals Febri gained her knowledge via Testament, leading Mikoto to believe Shinobu is involved. After receiving a call from Mitsuko about the importance of trusting friends, Mikoto realizes she should not have to do this alone and decides to inform Kuroko and the others about Febri's condition, becoming surprised and relieved to find they are more than willing to help. As Mikoto and her friends tries to find clues related to Febri, Yomikawa gives Mikoto a capsule found in the unmanned mech suit. Heaven Canceller examines the capsule which contains a strand of hair similar to Febri's, possibly belonging to her sister. However, he also reveals to Mikoto that Febri only has enough lollipops to stay alive for another 72 hours. With Mikoto deciding to face the darkness of Academy City once more in order to save Febri, Heaven Canceller arranges for her to meet someone familiar with the underground, that being Therestina Kihara Lifeline. \n\n\n22 (46)\n\"STUDY\"\n(STUDY) \nSeptember 13, 2013\n\n\nDespite being mocked by Therestina, Mikoto refuses to leave until she gets information to save Febri. Therestina hesitantly reveals that Febri is an artificial human called a Chemicaloid, which her creators were going to showcase at the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly. Mikoto tells the others about Febri's condition. Mitsuko, Kinoho and Maaya help Kazari identify the mysterious man as Haruki Aritomi, a longtime winner of the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly. Kazari discovers that Aritomi and other student geniuses formed the STUDY Corporation and purchased a factory, which Kazari suspects is where Febri and her lollipops were being made. Mikoto heads to the factory, spots ITEM fighting mechs sent by STUDY and overhears that the mechs are controlled via a form of psychogenesis by the capsules inside them. After ITEM leaves, Mikoto enters the factory and finds Shinobu, who had taught Febri how to say Mikoto's name so she would be protected by her. Shinobu gives Mikoto the data to make more neutralizer lollipops, only to learn from Aritomi that the information is fake, as this confirms that he suspected Shinobu was a traitor. Aritomi orders Shinobu to inject Mikoto with a tranquilizer in exchange the real neutralizer data, but after Shinobu does it, Aritomi breaks his word and destroys the data. Febri is revealed to be a spare to his true project, Janie. \n\n\n23 (47)\n\"Dawn of a Revolution (Silent Party)\"\n\"Kakumei Mimei\" (革命未明（Silent Party）) \nSeptember 20, 2013\n\n\nAritomi reveals he started Project Chemicaloid, which created Janie and Febri due to his bitterness that espers gain fame and recognition while intellectuals like him are ignored. To finally show their power, STUDY found a way to mass-produce espers which will bring forth a revolution upon Academy City tomorrow. Later, Shinobu explains to Mikoto how she was sold to STUDY after being captured by ITEM and was forced to work on the Chemicaloids, which were born from her research, becoming determined to save them. Using her own electricity to counter the paralysis in her body, Mikoto assures Shinobu that she does not need to take everything on by herself. Kuroko and the others arrive to rescue Mikoto, whilst Shinobu chooses to stay behind in order to do her part. After learning that 20,000 mechs, controlled by Janie's Diffusion Ghost ability, have been snuck into the Academy City Research Exhibition Assembly, with the Anti-Skills prevented from interfering, the girls make preparations to save Shinobu, Febri and Janie. The next morning, Kuroko, Kazari, Ruiko, Konori, Mitsuko, Kinoho and Maaya step up to face the mechs, whilst Mikoto and Febri head off in search of Janie. \n\n\n24 (48)\n\"Eternal Party\"\n(Eternal Party) \nSeptember 27, 2013\n\n\nThe entirety of Judgment joins Kuroko and the others in fighting off against STUDY's mechs. Meanwhile, Mikoto and Febri arrive at STUDY's hidden base at a stadium, fighting off against the mechs that Aritomi sends against them. STUDY responds by sending a signal to cut off everyone's communications and sending more advanced mechs after each group. However, they overcome this thanks to Erii and Banri setting up a network of telepaths, with Kazari and Ruiko piloting their own mech that Mitsuko's father sent over, whilst ITEM help to destroy the mechs sent after Mikoto. Mikoto and Febri soon arrive at the underground base, where Aritomi, having no other plans to stop her, resorts to initiating the final phase in which he reveals his secret weapon: a cluster missile from space containing Diffusion Ghost that will destroy Academy City and everyone who is in it, by causing a chain reaction with the city's AIM fields. Aritomi attempts to kill himself, only to be stopped by Mikoto, who is determined to save everyone. With the assistance of the Sisters, Mikoto rides in Mitsuko's mech and launches into the atmosphere, using the mech as ammunition for a massive railgun to destroy the missile. After freeing Janie from STUDY's control and reuniting her with Febri, who is given more neutralizer lollipops, Shinobu makes plans to bring the twins to an overseas research facility to cure their condition. After saying their goodbyes to Shinobu and the twins, Mikoto and the gang discuss their upcoming vacation. \n\n\nBonus\n\"All the Important Things I Learned in a Bathhouse\"\n\"Daiji na Koto wa Zenbu Sentō ni Osowatta\" (大事なことはぜんぶ銭湯に教わった) \nMarch 27, 2014[8]\n\n\nAs the local bathhouse comes under threat of being closed down, Mii enlists the help of Mikoto, Kuroko, Kazari and Ruiko to help promote interest, coming up with a Mikoto-powered \"electric bath\" to bring in more customers. At first, the baths become a success which attracts the attention of Erii, Mitsuko, Wannai, Atsuki, Yomikawa, Tsuzuri, Komoe, Shizuri, Frenda, Saiai, Rikō and the Dorm Supervisor. However, the baths are almost ruined after Kuroko adds too much bubble bath soap in one of her schemes to seduce Mikoto. After the customers go home, the girls celebrate by having a bath and drinking milk. \n\n\n\nQuestion: to aru kagaku no railgun s episode 3\nAnswer:", "answer": "Project Radio Noise", "aliases": []}

The first was Prafulla Chandra Ghosh of the Indian National Congress, who was succeeded by his party-mates Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy and Prafulla Chandra Sen.

The instability ended with 1977 election victory of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM). Headed by Jyoti Basu, the CPM-led Left Front government was in office for over 23 years (1977–2000). Left rule in West Bengal continued for another 10 years under Buddhadeb Bhattacharya, before its defeat in the 2011 election by the Trinamool Congress.

The most notorious was “Prof. Gentry's Famous Dog & Pony Show,” started when teenager Henry Gentry and his brothers started touring in 1886 with their act, originally entitled “Gentry’s Equine and Canine Paradox.” It started small, but evolved into a full circus show.[3] Other early dog and pony shows included Morris’ Equine and Canine Paradoxes (1883) and Hurlburt’s Dog and Pony Show (late 1880s).[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: where does the term dog and pony show come from\nAnswer:", "answer": "in the United States in the late-19th and early-20th centuries", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The Republic of Tecala, where most of Proof of Life is set, is a fictional South American country. Tecala has long been the scene of an internal conflict between its government forces and the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). The ELT was originally a Marxist guerrilla group supported by the Soviet Union, but after the Soviet Union's dissolution in 1991, the ELT's primary source of funding fell through, and they began kidnapping people for ransom to fund their operations. A map seen in the film is that of Ecuador. The country's capital Quito was chosen along with the eastern jungle and the nearby city of Baños de Agua Santa in the Ecuadorian Andes.\nAlice Bowman (Meg Ryan) moves to the (fictional) South American country of Tecala because her engineer husband, Peter Bowman (David Morse), has been hired to help build a new dam for oil company Quad Carbon. Though Alice is unhappy at this most recent move, she agrees to stay. While driving one morning through the city, Peter is caught in traffic and then ambushed and abducted by guerrilla rebels of the Liberation Army of Tecala (ELT). Believing that Peter is working on Quad Carbon's oil pipeline, ELT soldiers lead him through the jungle.\n\nQuestion: where does the movie proof of life take place\nAnswer:", "answer": "the (fictional) South American country of Tecala", "aliases": ["The Republic of Tecala"]}
{"context": "Context: The term monkey's uncle, most notably seen in the idiom \"(well) I'll be a monkey's uncle\", is used to express complete surprise, amazement or disbelief.[1] It can also be used to acknowledge the impossibility of a situation, in the same way that \"pigs might fly\" is used. An example is if one says: \"I may agree that if two plus two equals five, then I am a monkey's uncle\". \"I'll be a monkey's uncle\" has been said to date from after 1925, the date of the widely publicized Scopes Trial in the United States, where the term first appears.[2] The Oxford English Dictionary's earliest example is the phrase If that's a joke I'm a monkey's uncle, from an Ohio newspaper on 8 February 1925.[3] It was originally a sarcastic remark made by creationists.[4] The notion \"that [people] were descended from apes was considered blasphemous...by Darwin's contemporaries\", and it was for this reason that the sarcastic phrase came into use.[5]\n\nQuestion: where did the saying monkey's uncle come from\nAnswer:", "answer": "Scopes Trial in the United States", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The Tower of London, officially Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. It lies within the London Borough of Tower Hamlets, separated from the eastern edge of the square mile of the City of London by the open space known as Tower Hill. It was founded towards the end of 1066 as part of the Norman Conquest of England. The White Tower, which gives the entire castle its name, was built by William the Conqueror in 1078 and was a resented symbol of oppression, inflicted upon London by the new ruling elite. The castle was used as a prison from 1100 (Ranulf Flambard) until 1952 (Kray twins),[3] although that was not its primary purpose. A grand palace early in its history, it served as a royal residence. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard I, Henry III, and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.\n\nQuestion: what was the tower of london originally used for\nAnswer:", "answer": "a royal residence", "aliases": ["as a royal residence"]}

{"context": "Context: In C3 plants, the first step in the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis involves the fixation of CO2 by the enzyme RuBisCO into 3-phosphoglycerate. However, due to the dual carboxylase and oxygenase activity of RuBisCo, some part of the substrate is oxidized rather than carboxylated, resulting in loss of substrate and consumption of energy, in what is known as photorespiration. In order to bypass the photorespiration pathway, C4 plants have developed a mechanism to efficiently deliver CO2 to the RuBisCO enzyme. They utilize their specific leaf anatomy where chloroplasts exist not only in the mesophyll cells in the outer part of their leaves but in the bundle sheath cells as well. Instead of direct fixation to RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle, CO2 is incorporated into a 4-carbon organic acid, which has the ability to regenerate CO2 in the chloroplasts of the bundle sheath cells. Bundle sheath cells can then utilize this CO2 to generate carbohydrates by the conventional C3 pathway.\n\nQuestion: in photosynthesis the carbon in co2 is initially fixed to what molecule\nAnswer:", "answer": "3-phosphoglycerate", "aliases": []}

Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four Anglo-Mysore Wars.

The object of the stations is to help the Christians faithful to make a spiritual pilgrimage through contemplation of the Passion of Christ. It has become one of the most popular devotions and the stations can be found in many Western Christian churches, including Anglican,[1] Lutheran,[2] Methodist,[3] and Roman Catholic ones.\nThe Stations of the Cross originated in pilgrimages to Jerusalem and a desire to reproduce Via Dolorosa.

{"context": "Context: Formal definitions, first devised in the early 19th century, are given below. Informally, a function f assigns an output f(x) to every input x. We say the function has a limit L at an input p: this means f(x) gets closer and closer to L as x moves closer and closer to p. More specifically, when f is applied to any input sufficiently close to p, the output value is forced arbitrarily close to L.

(engrosser: probably Timothy Matlack)\n\n\nSignatories\n56 delegates to the Continental Congress\n\n\nPurpose\nTo announce and explain separation from Great Britain[1]\n\n\nAfter ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in several forms. It was initially published as the printed Dunlap broadside that was widely distributed and read to the public. The source copy used for this printing has been lost and may have been a copy in Thomas Jefferson's hand.[4] Jefferson's original draft is preserved at the Library of Congress, complete with changes made by John Adams and Benjamin Franklin, as well as Jefferson's notes of changes made by Congress. The best-known version of the Declaration is a signed copy that is displayed at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and which is popularly regarded as the official document. This engrossed copy was ordered by Congress on July 19 and signed primarily on August 2.[5][6]\nThe Declaration was passed on July 2 with no opposing votes. A committee of five had drafted it to be ready when Congress voted on independence. John Adams, a leader in pushing for independence, had persuaded the committee to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document,[2] which Congress edited to produce the final version. The Declaration was a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, more than a year after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. Adams wrote to his wife Abigail, \"The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America\"[3] – although Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the wording of the Declaration of Independence was approved.\nPolitical maneuvering was setting the stage for an official declaration of independence even while a document was being written to explain the decision. On June 11, 1776, Congress appointed a \"Committee of Five\" to draft a declaration, consisting of John Adams of Massachusetts, Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania, Thomas Jefferson of Virginia, Robert R. Livingston of New York, and Roger Sherman of Connecticut. The committee left no minutes, so there is some uncertainty about how the drafting process proceeded; contradictory accounts were written many years later by Jefferson and Adams, too many years to be regarded as entirely reliable—although their accounts are frequently cited.[63] What is certain is that the committee discussed the general outline which the document should follow and decided that Jefferson would write the first draft.[64] The committee in general, and Jefferson in particular, thought that Adams should write the document, but Adams persuaded the committee to choose Jefferson and promised to consult with him personally.[2] Considering Congress's busy schedule, Jefferson probably had limited time for writing over the next seventeen days, and likely wrote the draft quickly.[65] He then consulted the others and made some changes, and then produced another copy incorporating these alterations. The committee presented this copy to the Congress on June 28, 1776. The title of the document was \"A Declaration by the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress assembled.\"[66]\n\nQuestion: who wrote most of the declaration of independance\nAnswer:", "answer": "Thomas Jefferson", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: Judicial review is a process under which executive and (in some countries) legislative actions are subject to review by the judiciary. A court with judicial review power may invalidate laws and decisions that are incompatible with a higher authority; an executive decision may be invalidated for being unlawful or a statute may be invalidated for violating the terms of a written constitution. Judicial review is one of the checks and balances in the separation of powers: the power of the judiciary to supervise the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority. The doctrine varies between jurisdictions, so the procedure and scope of judicial review may differ between and within countries.\n\nQuestion: how does the power of judicial review check the legislative and executive branches\nAnswer:", "answer": "to supervise the legislative and executive branches when the latter exceed their authority", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The division of Korea between North and South Korea occurred after World War II, ending the Empire of Japan's 35-year rule over Korea in 1945. The United States and the Soviet Union occupied two parts of the country, with the boundary between their zones of control along the 38th parallel.\nAt the Tehran Conference and the Yalta Conference, the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe. On August 8, 1945, three months to the day after the end of hostilities in Europe, and two days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan.[8] Soviet troops advanced rapidly, and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea. On August 10, 1945 two young officers – Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel – were assigned to define an American occupation zone. Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared, they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel. They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control. No experts on Korea were consulted. The two men were unaware that forty years before, Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel. Rusk later said that had he known, he \"almost surely\" would have chosen a different line.[9][10] The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone.[11] To the surprise of the Americans, the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division. The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 (approved on 17 August 1945) for the surrender of Japan.[12]\n\nQuestion: when did korea separate into north and south\nAnswer:", "answer": "17 August 1945", "aliases": ["1945"]}
{"context": "Context: In the early 1800s, John Dalton used the concept of atoms to explain why elements always react in ratios of small whole numbers (the law of multiple proportions). For instance, there are two types of tin oxide: one is 88.1% tin and 11.9% oxygen and the other is 78.7% tin and 21.3% oxygen (tin(II) oxide and tin dioxide respectively). This means that 100g of tin will combine either with 13.5g or 27g of oxygen. 13.5 and 27 form a ratio of 1:2, a ratio of small whole numbers. This common pattern in chemistry suggested to Dalton that elements react in whole number multiples of discrete units—in other words, atoms. In the case of tin oxides, one tin atom will combine with either one or two oxygen atoms.[3]\n\nQuestion: who discovered the atom and in what year\nAnswer:", "answer": "John Dalton", "aliases": ["early 1800s"]}
{"context": "Context: Food is ingested through the mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx and then into the esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After food passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach.[8] When food is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing food from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of food to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the food down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to food that is in the mouth, and also as a response to the sensation of food within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.[8]\n\nQuestion: what is the purpose of the muscles that line the esophagus\nAnswer:", "answer": "push the food down the esophagus", "aliases": ["push the food down the esophagus."]}

Furthermore, the 5 and 5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn’t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus phablet models.

Bunchy shares his feelings about losing Teresa with his support group, Romero convinces him they should go and see her in Bakersfield on the trip Romero claims to have stabbed his own abuser in the eyes. Terry receives a weight plate shaped calling card from the Aryans. Ray gets confirmation from Lee Drexler that his contract with Paige is good and signs it. He is then called in by Finney to help delay a potential bidder for the NFL team, so that he misses the deadline. He despatches Lena to intercept this Mr Sylvester, whom they drug and deposit in a motel room. Paige gets the deal signed, though has to agree to a 10% break fee. Bunchy visits Teresa and asks her to marry him, despite her protestations he says he will wait at a diner down the street until she changes her mind. At the diner, Romero tricks Bunchy into saying how his abuser was despatched. Teresa does arrive and agrees to go with Bunchy – but only if he agrees to: tell the truth, be faithful, not hit her and drop the name Bunchy, Brendan agrees. At the election party Abby is introduced to Verona and the Finney clan. Ray leaves for a while to attend to a petrified Terry. On returning, with Verona losing the election and having found out about the deal with Paige, Finney expresses his disappointment at Ray.\n\n\n31\n7\n\"All Must Be Loved\"\nTucker Gates\nDavid Hollander\nAugust 23, 2015 (2015-08-23)\n1.37[32]\n\n\nTerry’s specialist advises him that recent events are normal for Parkinson’s and he should really have in-home support, Ray agrees with Abby that he could move in with them, Terry later declines. Darryl is beaten and his car is taken by the Armenians who had come after a $30k payment, Mickey says he will sort it out and arranges to meet them with the money. Bunchy tells his family of his intention to marry Teresa and asks Ray for his settlement money. Ray OK’s the financing for Abby’s father’s bar. Paige tells Donovan she is divorcing Varick and fronts Ray $200k to bribe Helen Miller of Fish & Game. Romero calls Ray and asks for a meet, saying he knows about Father O’Connor’s murder. At the meeting he offers forgiveness if Ray confesses, Ray starts to confess then leaves – Romero follows but Ray turns on the priest and beats him until Terry pulls him off – Romero excommunicates them but calls for Ray to repent. Bunchy goes to Mickey looking for more work, Mickey takes him to the meeting with the Armenians, who, on discovering Mickey has given them play money lay in to Mickey and Darryl outnumbering and overwhelming them until Bunchy steps in – Darryl later tells Mickey that reprisals are a certainty. Bridget's crush on her tutor, Greg Donellen, moves to the next level. Paige summons Ray on the pretext of business, but on arriving her motives are clearly more about pleasure.\n\n\n32\n8\n\"Tulip\"\nMichael Uppendahl\nDavid Hollander & William Wheeler\nAugust 30, 2015 (2015-08-30)\n1.44[33]\n\n\nPaige tells Ray, her overnight guest, that they must seal the deal with Napier that week to keep everything on track. Ray enlists Helen Miller to provide some evidence (snakes which have been used to traffic drugs) which will be planted on Miller. Despite good planning by Ray and Lena, one of the snakes bites Miller, thwarting their plans. Romero shows up at the gym and has Bunchy summon Ray. Armed and ready to dispose of another priest, Ray is surprised when Romero simply hands him all of the evidence that he has gathered and leaves. The Armenians take revenge by torching Daryll’s car. The investigating police officer tells Mickey that she is aware of his activities and that he can either become an informant again or he, Darryl and Bunchy will likely face jail. Mickey later calls her and agrees. A disgruntled Varick is denied access to Finney so sneaks in through a back door. He threatens to expose his relationship with Finney who responds by hitting him, fatally, with a fire poker. Finney calls in Ray who, in turn, brings Avi back to help clean up with Lena. Burning and burying Varick’s body (along with Romero’s evidence) in a deep desert grave, Avi tries to convince Ray that Kate's murder was for Ray’s good. Finney, as agreed with Ray, tells Paige he will pay Napier’s price for the land and that she can take control of the deal going forward. Avi lays a false trail suggesting Varick fled south of the border. Bridget visits Donellen at home. He is on painkillers, and after he falls asleep on the couch Bridget snuggles up alongside him. Abby gets Terry cleaned up somewhat and he ends up staying in the room that Abby had prepared for him.\n\n\n33\n9\n\"The Octopus\"\nColin Bucksey\nBrett Johnson\nSeptember 6, 2015 (2015-09-06)\n1.41[34]\n\n\nMickey is required by Detective Muncie to work with them on a sting operation against the Minassians and their Russian supplier of trafficked girls, Ivan Belikov. Preparations for Bunchy’s wedding are underway but at the rehearsal dinner Ray gives less a best man’s speech, more a mumbled couple of sentences. Ray has Lena check out Teresa and family, who are mostly clean. Terry’s Parkinson’s (or meds) give him nightmares and when checking out the noise Abby and Ray find a shaken and embarrassed Terry has wet the bed. The NFL is checking the Finneys' deal and the absence of Varick leads them to have one of their investigators, disgraced former FBI director Ed Cochran, look into the deal. Cochran seems to relish the prospect of encountering Ray again. Mickey hides out in a motel. Muncie goes looking for him and arrests groom-to-be Bunchy when Mickey cannot be located. Ray agrees with Muncie to swap father for brother, then tracks down Mickey and convinces him to return. Mickey meets with the Minassians and sees the pictures of the sex-slaves that Belikov is controlling; he is shaken by these. Bridget is out bowling with Donellen who admits his feelings for her. Bunchy and Teresa are married and the reception is a success with Ray delivering a fine and moving speech. Mickey asks Ray for help with his situation. Ray asks Lena to look into the Minassians.\n\n\n34\n10\n\"One Night in Yerevan\"\nDan Attias\nGina Welch & David Hollander\nSeptember 13, 2015 (2015-09-13)\n1.43[35]\n\n\nRay is planning to get Mickey out of his sticky situation with the cops by working with old employer Lee Drexler. Ray gets Lee to act as a legal representative for Mickey. Their angle is to say that Mickey is senile, which is signed off on by a doctor whom they pay, and then appoint Ray as his guardian. That means that Mickey can’t rightfully participate in Muncie’s sting. Ray also tries to convince the Minassians to let Mickey out of the deal they made, and asks for help from an Armenian pop star whom Ray had helped out in the past. Meanwhile, Cochran is gathering more evidence in his investigation of Ray, using the vetting of the Finney NFL deal as a reason to dig into any potential dirty business. Cochran is getting closer to learning the truth. He meets with Finney, gets a sense of where he stands, and also bribes his way into Avi’s storage locker. Worried about Bridget, Abby searches her room for something that will help her figure out what’s wrong. She finds Mr. Donellen’s pill bottle and confronts Bridget about it. When Abby learns the truth, she first threatens to call the cops. Donellen lies to Abby telling her that Bridget is obsessed with him because they both lost loved ones.\n\n\n35\n11\n\"Poker\"\nColin Bucksey\nMichael Tolkin & Brett Johnson\nSeptember 20, 2015 (2015-09-20)\n1.45[36]\n\n\nCochran sends the LAPD, via their website, a map of where Varick’s body is buried, his screen observed remotely by Avi and Lena. He then plants the poker at Ray's apartment and has Finney tell the police chief that it was Ray who killed Varick. Finney asks Paige to back him up. Avi calls Ray and they agree the body should be moved. Ray answers some of a detective’s questions about Varick, but Lee Drexler arrives and concludes the conversation. Lee tells Ray that Finney had implicated him; Ray sees Finney’s lawyer and tells him to have Finney recant his statement. Cochran arrives home to find Ray there, Ray asks where the poker is, but it takes a bullet to the leg and some persuasion to get the location. Ray recovers the poker just before the police arrive – Lena speeds it away. Bridget, though grounded, visits Donellen and tells him how she feels but he gently rebuffs her. Abby arrives and takes Bridget away. Terry makes a pass at Abby. Ray intercepts Paige on her way into the LAPD offices and he tries to convince her to tell the truth. She tells the police that Finney killed Varick and that they were lovers. Ray and his team deposit the body and poker in a dumpster at Finney’s home. Paige tells Finney she made her statement, but not its contents, and Lena torches the body. Ray and his team return a bruised Cochran to Dybek. Mickey avoids having to move to Reno by convincing his boys he has Alzheimer’s, and claims that he is scared that Ray will lock him away somewhere. Ray confronts Mickey, and Mickey tells Ray they will all hate him if he is sent away, forcing Ray to relent.\n\n\n36\n12\n\"Exsuscito\"\nDavid Hollander\nDavid Hollander & William Wheeler\nSeptember 27, 2015 (2015-09-27)\n1.50[37]\n\n\nTV news covers unfolding events at the Finney house, Paige arrives at Ray’s apartment to ride out the media storm.

The elder Ryan had served with the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division at the Battle of the Bulge in western Europe. His mother, Catherine Burke Ryan (1923–1974), was a nurse.

{"context": "Context: The theory of the objective correlative as it relates to literature was largely developed through the writings of the poet and literary critic T.S. Eliot, who is associated with the literary group called the New Critics. Helping define the objective correlative, Eliot's essay \"Hamlet and His Problems\",[1] republished in his book The Sacred Wood: Essays on Poetry and Criticism discusses his view of Shakespeare's incomplete development of Hamlet's emotions in the play Hamlet. Eliot uses Lady Macbeth's state of mind as an example of the successful objective correlative  : \"The artistic 'inevitability' lies in this complete adequacy of the external to the emotion….\" , as a contrast to Hamlet. According to Eliot, the feelings of Hamlet are not sufficiently supported by the story and the other characters surrounding him. The objective correlative's purpose is to express the character's emotions by showing rather than describing feelings as discussed earlier by Plato and referred to by Peter Barry in his book Beginning Theory: An Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory as \"...perhaps little more than the ancient distinction (first made by Plato) between mimesis and diegesis….\" (28). According to Formalist critics, this action of creating an emotion through external factors and evidence linked together and thus forming an objective correlative should produce an author's detachment from the depicted character and unite the emotion of the literary work. The \"occasion\" of E. Montale is a further form of correlative.\n\nQuestion: who gave the famous objective co relative theory\nAnswer:", "answer": "poet and literary critic T.S.

{"context": "Context: The world's first movable type printing press technology for printing paper books was made of porcelain materials and was invented around AD 1040 in China during the Northern Song Dynasty by the inventor Bi Sheng (990–1051).[1] Subsequently in 1377, the world's oldest extant movable metal print book, Jikji, was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty. Because of this, the diffusion of both movable-type systems was, to some degree, limited to primarily East Asia, although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries, traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe. Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others.[2] Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg introduced the metal movable-type printing press in Europe, along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould. The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor.[3] Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony—and these materials remained standard for 550 years.[4]\nJohannes Gutenberg of Mainz, Germany is acknowledged as the first to invent a metal movable-type printing system in Europe, the printing press. Gutenberg was a goldsmith familiar with techniques of cutting punches for making coins from moulds. Between 1436 and 1450 he developed hardware and techniques for casting letters from matrices using a device called the hand mould.[29] Gutenberg's key invention and contribution to movable-type printing in Europe, the hand mould, was the first practical means of making cheap copies of letterpunches in the vast quantities needed to print complete books, making the movable-type printing process a viable enterprise.\n\nQuestion: who is often associated with printing the first book using moveable type in germany\nAnswer:", "answer": "Johannes Gutenberg", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The number of chromosomes found in a single complete set of chromosomes is called the monoploid number (x). The haploid number (n) is unique to gametes (sperm or egg cells), and refers to the total number of chromosomes found in a gamete, which under normal conditions is half the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell.\nGametes (sperm and ova) are haploid cells. The haploid gametes produced by most organisms combine to form a zygote with n pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2n chromosomes in total. The chromosomes in each pair, one of which comes from the sperm and one from the egg, are said to be homologous. Cells and organisms with pairs of homologous chromosomes are called diploid. For example, most animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes. During meiosis, sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly \"choosing\" one member of each pair of chromosomes, resulting in haploid gametes. Because homologous chromosomes usually differ genetically, gametes usually differ genetically from one another.[citation needed]\n\nQuestion: where are haploid cells found in the human body\nAnswer:", "answer": "gametes (sperm or egg cells)", "aliases": ["ova", "sperm", "sperm or egg cells"]}

The record stood for four years until it was broken by India's Mohammed Azharuddin.[5] Azharuddin remained the top-scorer in the format until his compatriot Sachin Tendulkar passed him in October 2000.[6] As of August 2016, eleven players—from six teams that are Full members of the International Cricket Council—have scored more than 10,000 runs in ODIs. Four of these are from Sri Lanka and three from India. The rest are one player each from Pakistan, Australia, West Indies, and South Africa.[7] Bangladesh, England, New Zealand, and Zimbabwe are yet to have a player reach the 10,000-run mark in this format.\n\nQuestion: how many players have scored 10000 runs in odi\nAnswer:", "answer": "eleven", "aliases": ["11"]}

{"context": "Context: Michael Schumacher holds the record for the most Grand Prix victories, having won 91 times.[5] Lewis Hamilton is second with 62 wins and Alain Prost is third with 51 wins. Michael Schumacher holds the distinction of having the longest time between his first win and his last. He won his first Grand Prix in 1992 at the Belgian Grand Prix, and his last in 2006 at the Chinese Grand Prix, a span of 14 years, 1 month and 1 day.[6] Riccardo Patrese holds the record for the longest period of time between two race wins–more than six-and-a-half years between the 1983 South African Grand Prix and the 1990 San Marino Grand Prix.[7] Mario Andretti had to wait the longest time between his maiden victory at the 1971 South African Grand Prix and his second win–coming five years, seven months and 18 days later at the 1976 Japanese Grand Prix.[8] Sebastian Vettel holds the record for the most consecutive wins, having won nine Grands Prix in a row from the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix to the 2013 Brazilian Grand Prix. Max Verstappen is the youngest winner of a Grand Prix; he was 18 years and 227 days old when he won the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix.[9] Luigi Fagioli is the oldest winner of a Formula One Grand Prix; he

{"context": "Context: While the specific nucleotide sequence of a mRNA specifies which amino acids are incorporated into the protein product of the gene from which the mRNA is transcribed, the role of tRNA is to specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid.[3] The mRNA encodes a protein as a series of contiguous codons, each of which is recognized by a particular tRNA. One end of the tRNA matches the genetic code in a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon. The anticodon forms three base pairs with a codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis. On the other end of the tRNA is a covalent attachment to the amino acid that corresponds to the anticodon sequence. Each type of tRNA molecule can be attached to only one type of amino acid, so each organism has many types of tRNA. Because the genetic code contains multiple codons that specify the same amino acid, there are several tRNA molecules bearing different anticodons which carry the same amino acid.\nA transfer RNA (abbreviated tRNA and formerly referred to as sRNA, for soluble RNA[1]) is an adaptor molecule composed of RNA, typically 76 to 90 nucleotides in length,[2] that serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins. tRNA does this by carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell (ribosome) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence (codon) in a messenger RNA (mRNA). As such, tRNAs are a necessary component of translation, the biological synthesis of new proteins in accordance with the genetic code.\n\nQuestion: what is the function of trnas in protein synthesis\nAnswer:", "answer": "carrying an amino acid to the protein synthetic machinery of a cell (ribosome) as directed by a three-nucleotide sequence (codon) in a messenger RNA (mRNA", "aliases": ["serves as the physical link between the mRNA and the amino acid sequence of proteins", "to specify which sequence from the genetic code corresponds to which amino acid"]}

{"context": "Context: Trigger points form only in muscles. They form as a local contraction in a small number of muscle fibers in a larger muscle or muscle bundle. These in turn can pull on tendons and ligaments associated with the muscle and can cause pain deep within a joint where there are no muscles. The integrated hypothesis theory states that trigger points form from excessive release of acetylcholine which produces sustained depolarization of muscle fibers. Indeed, the trigger point has an abnormal biochemical composition with elevated concentrations of acetylcholine, noradrenaline and serotonin and a lower pH.[12] These sustained contractions of muscle sarcomeres compresses local blood supply restricting the energy needs of the local region. This crisis of energy produces sensitizing substances that interact with some nociceptive (pain) nerves traversing in the local region which in turn can produce localized pain within the muscle at the neuromuscular junction (Travell and Simons 1999). When trigger points are present in muscles there is often pain and weakness in the associated structures. These pain patterns in muscles follow specific nerve pathways and have been readily mapped to allow for identification of the causative pain factor. Many trigger points have pain patterns that overlap, and some create reciprocal cyclic relationships that need to be treated extensively to remove them.\nMyofascial trigger points, also known as trigger points, are described as hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle. They are associated with palpable nodules in taut bands of muscle fibers.[1] They are a topic of ongoing controversy, as there is limited data to inform a scientific understanding of the phenomenon. Accordingly, a formal acceptance of myofascial \"knots\" as an identifiable source of pain is more common among bodyworkers, physical therapists, chiropractors, and osteopathic practitioners. Nonetheless, the concept of trigger points provides a framework which may be used to help address certain musculoskeletal pain.\n\nQuestion: where are trigger points located in the body\nAnswer:", "answer": "muscles", "aliases": ["in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle", "hyperirritable spots in the fascia surrounding skeletal muscle"]}

{"context": "Context: Husrev Pasha was the first Ottoman governor of Egypt after the expulsion of the French. The form of government, however, was not the same as that before the French invasion, for the Mamluks were not reinstated. The pasha, and through him the Sultan, repeatedly tried to either ensnare them or to beguile them into submission. These efforts failing, Husrev took the field and a Turkish detachment 7,000 strong was dispatched against the Mamluks to Damanhur—whence they had descended from Upper Egypt—and was defeated by a small force under either al-Alfi or his lieutenant al-Bardisi. Their ammunition and guns fell into the hands of the Mamluks. This led to a long civil war between the Albanians, Mamluks, and Ottomans.\nEgypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty remained nominally an Ottoman province. It was granted the status of an autonomous vassal state or Khedivate in 1867. Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha governed Egypt as a quasi-independent state under Ottoman suzerainty until the British occupation of 1882. Nevertheless, the Khedivate of Egypt (1867–1914) remained a de jure Ottoman province until 5 November 1914,[4] when it was declared a British protectorate in reaction to the decision of the Young Turks of the Ottoman Empire to join the First World War on the side of the Central Powers.\n\nQuestion: who was the ottoman governor who led egypt in the years following the napoleonic wars\nAnswer:", "answer": "Husrev Pasha", "aliases": ["Isma'il Pasha and Tewfik Pasha"]}

{"context": "Context: It is an allusion to Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (1798).[1] In the poem, an albatross starts to follow a ship — being followed by an albatross was generally considered a sign of good luck. However, the titular mariner shoots the albatross with a crossbow, which is regarded as an act that will curse the ship (which indeed suffers terrible mishaps). Even when they are too thirsty to speak, the ship's crew let the mariner know through their glances that they blame his action for the curse. The albatross is then literally hung around the mariner's neck by the crew to symbolize his guilt in killing the bird. Thus, the albatross can be both an omen of good or bad luck, as well as a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance.\n\nQuestion: the rime of the ancient mariner albatross symbolism\nAnswer:", "answer": "omen of good or bad luck", "aliases": ["a burden to be carried as penance", "a metaphor for a burden to be carried as penance"]}

{"context": "Context: The famous fossils found near Hagerman, Idaho were originally thought to be a part of the genus Plesippus. Hagerman Fossil Beds (Idaho) is a Pliocene site, dating to about 3.5 mya. The fossilized remains were originally called Plesippus shoshonensis, but further study by paleontologists determined the fossils represented the oldest remains of the genus Equus.[22] Their estimated average weight was 425 kg, roughly the size of an Arabian horse.\nThe first Old World equid fossil was found in the gypsum quarries in Montmartre, Paris, in the 1820s. The tooth was sent to the Paris Conservatory, where it was identified by Georges Cuvier, who identified it as a browsing equine related to the tapir.[5] His sketch of the entire animal matched later skeletons found at the site.[6]\nThe genus Equus, which includes all extant equines, is believed to have evolved from Dinohippus, via the intermediate form Plesippus. One of the oldest species is Equus simplicidens, described as zebra-like with a donkey-shaped head. The oldest fossil to date is ~3.5 million years old from Idaho, USA.

McClure in multiple American newspapers and then published in the British publication Black and White in April 1892[1] and the following year as the title story in the collection, The Real Thing and Other Stories published by Macmillan. This story, often read as a parable, plays with the reality-illusion dichotomy that fascinated James, especially in the later stages of his career. For the illustrator who narrates the story, the genuine article proves all too useless for his commercial purposes. The story portrays the unfortunate victims of a society in which reality and representation are closely intertwined in ways that make art a difficult project to untangle the two.\n\nQuestion: what is henry james the real thing about\nAnswer:", "answer": "the unfortunate victims of a society in which reality and representation are closely intertwined in ways that make art a difficult project to untangle the two", "aliases": []}

Since the office of Lieutenant Governor fell vacant after Lt. Gov. David Paterson succeeded to the governorship upon Gov. Eliot Spitzer's resignation, the majority leaders (Bruno, Skelos and Smith) have acted as lieutenant governors. The motions put forward on June 8 also sought to select Pedro Espada as Temporary President of the State Senate, which would have installed him as acting lieutenant governor.

{"context": "Context: The core of a conventional optical fiber is a cylinder of glass or plastic that runs along the fiber's length.[1] The core is surrounded by a medium with a lower index of refraction, typically a cladding of a different glass, or plastic. Light travelling in the core reflects from the core-cladding boundary due to total internal reflection, as long as the angle between the light and the boundary is less than the critical angle. As a result, the fiber transmits all rays that enter the fiber with a sufficiently small angle to the fiber's axis.

Meredith is uncertain what the future holds after she has sex with Derek and whether he is willing to leave Addison after a marriage of eleven years. Addison finds Meredith's panties in Derek's tux pocket, and realizes that he slept with Meredith. After spending the night in his office, Webber is confronted by his wife, Adele (Loretta Devine). She gives him an ultimatum, forcing him to decide between his career and his marriage. Addison and Alex treat a newborn baby who was found abandoned in a trash can, and they are faced with four minors who could be the mother. George seeks relationship advice from Derek after they are forced to stay under quarantine in the locker room, when Derek confesses his feeling towards Meredith. Bailey gets attached to a patient in isolation whose wife dies, and relives the moments when her husband's life was threatened.\n\n\n38\n2\n\"I Am a Tree\"\nJeff Melman\nKrista Vernoff\nSeptember 28, 2006 (2006-09-28)\n23.48[6]\n\n\nCristina makes a bad first impression on Burke's parents and is also surprised to find that he is a \"mama's boy\". Burke's mother believes that Cristina is too selfish and driven for her son, and is only trying to take advantage of his extensive knowledge of cardiothoracic surgery. Izzie uses baking to cope with her grieving, and bakes hundreds of muffins. After pinning Meredith's panties to a bulletin board, Addison takes a day off from the hospital and spends the day drinking. Due to Addison taking the day off, Bailey has Alex help her in the pit, and they're faced with a teenage patient who has been impaled on a tree branch. A brain tumor patient quizzes Meredith and Cristina over their respective relationships. Webber discovers that Callie has been living in the hospital and tells her she has to leave because of hospital policy. Bailey finds the panties on the bulletin board and loses it, demanding to know who they belong to. Callie sees Meredith's embarrassment and takes the blame, which in turn causes George to become jealous, fearing Callie might have cheated on him. A surgical patient lives what may be her last day to the fullest. Meredith must choose between Derek and Finn, and struggles coming to a decision.

Izzie attempts to return to the hospital for the first time since she left the program, but ends up standing in front of the hospital all day, unable to go in and confront Webber. Alex treats a young patient who has a long history of injuries, leading him to suspect abuse. It is discovered that she can't feel pain which makes her believe she is a super hero. Derek and Cristina treat a man who elects to have brain surgery so he is able to look after his child. George gets annoyed at Callie after she moves in with him, resulting in them arguing over a patient. Meredith gets annoyed as both Derek and Finn interrupt the other as they are dating her.

Addison works with a pregnant woman who wants to give birth naturally, but needs to have a cesarean section. Addison begins to doubt her abilities as a surgeon after Derek broke up with her; Addison takes Alex off her rotation. Meredith is high from the painkillers and she and Addison speak frankly and apologize to each other. The interns work with a car salesman who wants to get back to his regular routine after he has a risky surgery, however, he lights a cigarette that catches his face on fire. Derek and Mark argue over the best way to treat him, each believing that their specialty is the most important and pressing. Callie breaks things off with George after he stands her up for Izzie, and she later hooks up with Mark. Derek clears Burke for surgery again, but Burke has serious doubts about whether his hand is ready or able to perform surgery again. He keeps his doubts to himself, except to tell Cristina. He practices on a corpse and he and Cristina realize his hand can't perform surgery unless he has help. They decide together to hide the truth by having Cristina assist him in his surgeries.

Bailey wants to scrub in and writes her name on the surgical board as the resident in charge. Cristina erases Bailey's name in order to cover for Burke's hand tremor, which leads Bailey to believe that he was the one responsible for the deletion, leading her to question her talent for surgery and becoming discouraged.

Bailey confronts Cristina after realizing that she was the one to erase Bailey's name off the surgery board, not Burke, and finally regains confidence in her abilities as a surgeon. As a result, Bailey takes revenge on Cristina by assigning her to the case of a child who swallowed 21 Monopoly pieces, and keeps her off surgeries until she admits why she took Bailey's name off the board. Izzie has to have a counselling session with Sydney, the perky resident who annoyed the interns when Bailey was on maternity leave.\n\n\n44\n8\n\"Staring at the Sun\"\nJeff Melman\nGabrielle Stanton & Harry Werksman, Jr.\nNovember 16, 2006 (2006-11-16)\n20.92[12]\n\n\nHarold O'Malley is admitted to Seattle Grace Hospital, and George's brothers come along and become friendly with Callie.

Mark is determined to leave Seattle for good, and irritates Meredith and Alex by making them tend to a patient who will need constant attention but Meredith accidentally gives Mark incentive to stay after letting him know of the open Chief position.

The attending physicians at Seattle Grace Hospital fight to get Webber's attention, but he expresses his disappointment in their conduct. He also forces Bailey to get signatures from all the attendings so she can create a free medical clinic, before confessing to her that he thinks she will be Chief one day.

Izzie is not supportive of their marriage and tries to get George to realize the mistake he has made. George and Webber treat a patient with cancer, but her blood has a neurotoxin in it that causes all the staff around her to fall ill. The staff have to operate on her in hazmat suits, and later in small bursts to complete her surgery. Cristina doesn't give Burke an answer to his proposal, but after watching him risk his life during the surgery, she agrees to marry him. Meanwhile, Meredith's Alzheimer's-stricken mother, Ellis Grey, experiences a change in her medical condition by becoming lucid for the day. She is disappointed in the mediocrity her daughter has fallen into and begins to despise Derek, blaming him for what happened to the Meredith that used to be \"a force of nature\".

Alex helps Jane Doe choose what her face will look like after Mark performs reconstructive surgery on her. He also gives her a new perspective on how the world will see her from then on. The hospital board begins interviewing the candidates for the Chief's position, and Colin intimidates everyone with his ten-year plan. However, after taking advice from Bailey, Mark seems to have convinced the board that he is appropriate for the job, despite continuous efforts from Derek, Burke, and Addison, whose careers in the hospital outlast his.

{"context": "Context: Escherichia coli (/ˌɛʃɪˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/;[1] also known as E. coli) is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms (endotherms).[2][3] Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for product recalls due to food contamination.[4][5] The harmless strains are part of the normal flora of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2,[6] and preventing colonization of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a symbiotic relationship.[7][8] E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.[9]\n\nQuestion: what is the full scientific name for the e. coli bacteria\nAnswer:", "answer": "Escherichia coli", "aliases": []}

However, twelve members could not attend, eleven of them trapped in besieged Jerusalem and one abroad. The remaining 25 signatories present were called up in alphabetical order to sign, leaving spaces for those absent. Although a space was left for him between the signatures of Eliyahu Dobkin and Meir Vilner, Zerach Warhaftig signed at the top of the next column, leading to speculation that Vilner's name had been left alone to isolate him, or to stress that even a communist agreed with the declaration.[15] However, Warhaftig later denied this, stating that a space had been left for him (as he was one of the signatories trapped in Jerusalem) where a Hebraicised form of his name would have fitted alphabetically, but he insisted on signing under his actual name so as to honour his father's memory and so moved down two spaces. He and Vilner would be the last surviving signatories, and remained close for the rest of their lives.

This practice is a variation on the Freedom of the City tradition, and has a similar symbolic meaning; evoking medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night, the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents.[14]\n\n\nQuestion: what does the keys to the city mean\nAnswer:", "answer": "symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents", "aliases": ["evoking medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night, the key symbolises the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will, as a trusted friend of city residents"]}
{"context": "Context: In modern mapping, a topographic map is a type of map characterized by large-scale detail and quantitative representation of relief, usually using contour lines, but historically using a variety of methods. Traditional definitions require a topographic map to show both natural and man-made features. A topographic map is typically published as a map series, made up of two or more map sheets that combine to form the whole map. A contour line is a line connecting places of equal elevation.\n\nQuestion: what is one element a topographic map shows\nAnswer:", "answer": "relief", "aliases": []}
{"context": "Context: The 2017 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) \"for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition on such weapons,\" according to the Norwegian Nobel Committee announcement on October 6, 2017.[1] The award announcement acknowledged the fact that \"the world's nine nuclear-armed powers and their allies\" neither signed nor supported the treaty-based prohibition known as the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons or nuclear ban treaty, yet in an interview Committee Chair Berit Reiss-Andersen told reporters that the award was intended to give \"encouragement to all players in the field\" to disarm.[2] The award was hailed by civil society as well as governmental and intergovernmental representatives who support the nuclear ban treaty, but drew criticism from those opposed. At the Nobel Peace Prize award ceremony held in Oslo City Hall on December 10, 2017, Setsuko Thurlow, an 85-year-old survivor of the 1945 atomic bombing of Hiroshima, and ICAN Executive Director Beatrice Fihn jointly received a medal and diploma of the award on behalf of ICAN and delivered the Nobel lecture.[3]\n\n\nQuestion: who won the nobel peace prize for 2017\nAnswer:", "answer": "the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)", "aliases": ["International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN)"]}
{"context": "Context: Although the Justice League first appeared in season six's \"Justice\", each member had their own introduction and recurring storylines in the series prior to the formation of the team. The first member to appear on Smallville, other than Clark Kent (Tom Welling), was Bart Allen (Kyle Gallner), who was introduced in the season four episode \"Run\". In the episode, Bart is the first person Clark discovers to have a superhuman ability—being able to run at supersonic speeds—that was not created from exposure to kryptonite. When Clark and Bart first meet, Bart is a pickpocket who saves Jonathan Kent (John Schneider) from being hit by a truck. Eventually, Clark convinces Bart to give up his life of crime.[1] Arthur Curry (Alan Ritchson), who has the ability to swim at superhuman speeds and create energy blasts through the water, is next to appear in the season five episode \"Aqua\". Arthur arrives in Smallville to stop an underwater weapon developed by Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum), which is killing the surrounding ocean life. Arthur and Clark initially clash on Arthur's tactics; Arthur tries to blow up Lex's lab, while Clark insists that they should simply talk to Lex face-to-face and ask him to stop. Eventually, Arthur and Clark locate and destroy the weapon outright.[2] Season five also introduced Victor Stone (Lee Thompson Young) in the episode \"Cyborg\". Here, it is revealed that Victor was mortally wounded in a car accident that also took the lives of his family, but Lex's company, LuthorCorp, took Victor's body to a research lab where they experimented on him—ultimately replacing his bone skeleton with a metal one. Clark attempts to provide Victor with a safe haven after Victor escapes from Lex's facility. Clark manages to convince Lex to stop hunting Victor, who eventually leaves Smallville with his girlfriend.[3]\n\nQuestion: when does clark meet the flash in smallville\nAnswer:", "answer": "the season four episode \"Run\"", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The Tea Party was the culmination of a resistance movement throughout British America against the Tea Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament in 1773. Colonists objected to the Tea Act because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to \"No taxation without representation\", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented. In addition, the well-connected East India Company had been granted competitive advantages over colonial tea importers, who resented the move and feared additional infringement on their business. Protesters had successfully prevented the unloading of taxed tea in three other colonies, but in Boston, embattled Royal Governor Thomas Hutchinson refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.\n\nQuestion: why did the colonists have a problem with the tea act of 1773\nAnswer:", "answer": "because they believed that it violated their rights as Englishmen to \"No taxation without representation\", that is, to be taxed only by their own elected representatives and not by a British parliament in which they were not represented", "aliases": []}
{"context": "Context: Easter eggs, also called Paschal eggs,[1] are decorated eggs that are usually used as gifts on the occasion of Easter. As such, Easter eggs are common during the season of Eastertide (Easter season). The oldest tradition is to use dyed and painted chicken eggs, but a modern custom is to substitute chocolate eggs wrapped in colourful foil, hand-carved wooden eggs, or plastic eggs filled with confectionery such as chocolate. However, real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition. Although eggs, in general, were a traditional symbol of fertility and rebirth,[2] in Christianity, for the celebration of Eastertide, Easter eggs symbolize the empty tomb of Jesus, from which Jesus resurrected.[3][4][5] In addition, one ancient tradition was the staining of Easter eggs with the colour red \"in memory of the blood of Christ, shed as at that time of his crucifixion.\"[3][6] This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia, and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches, and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches.[6][7][8][9] This Christian use of eggs may have been influenced by practices in \"pre-dynastic period in Egypt, as well as amid the early cultures of Mesopotamia and Crete\".[10]\n\nQuestion: who started the tradition of coloring easter eggs\nAnswer:", "answer": "early Christians of Mesopotamia", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: Chymotrypsin is synthesized in the pancreas by protein biosynthesis as a precursor called chymotrypsinogen that is enzymatically inactive. Trypsin activates chymotrypsinogen by cleaving peptidic bonds in positions Arg15 - Ile16 and produces π-Chymotrypsin. In turn, aminic group (-NH3+) of the Ile16 residue interacts with the side chain of Glu194, producing the \"oxyanion hole\" and the hydrophobic \"S1 pocket\". Moreover, Chymotrypsin induces its own activation by cleaving in positions 14-15, 146-147 and 148-149, producing α-Chymotrypsin (which is more active and stable than π-Chymotrypsin).[citation needed] The resulting molecule is a three-polypeptide molecule interconnected via disulfide bonds.\nIn vivo, chymotrypsin is a proteolytic enzyme (Serine protease) acting in the digestive systems of many organisms. It facilitates the cleavage of peptide bonds by a hydrolysis reaction, which despite being thermodynamically favorable occurs extremely slowly in the absence of a catalyst. The main substrates of chymotrypsin are peptide bonds in which the amino acid N-terminal to the bond is a tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, or leucine. Like many proteases, chymotrypsin will also hydrolyse amide bonds in vitro, a virtue that enabled the use of substrate analogs such as N-acetyl-L-phenylalanine p-nitrophenyl amide for enzyme assays.\nChymotrypsin (EC 3.4.21.1, chymotrypsins A and B, alpha-chymar ophth, avazyme, chymar, chymotest, enzeon, quimar, quimotrase, alpha-chymar, alpha-chymotrypsin A, alpha-chymotrypsin) is a digestive enzyme component of pancreatic juice acting in the duodenum where it performs proteolysis, the breakdown of proteins and polypeptides.[2] Chymotrypsin preferentially cleaves peptide amide bonds where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P1 position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine). These amino acids contain an aromatic ring in their sidechain that fits into a 'hydrophobic pocket' (the S1 position) of the enzyme. It is activated in the presence of trypsin. The hydrophobic and shape complementarity between the peptide substrate P1 sidechain and the enzyme S1 binding cavity accounts for the substrate specificity of this enzyme.[3][4] Chymotrypsin also hydrolyzes other amide bonds in peptides at slower rates, particularly those containing leucine and methionine at the P1 position.\n\nQuestion: where does cleavage of the peptide bond by chymotrypsin occur\nAnswer:", "answer": "positions 14-15, 146-147 and 148-149", "aliases": ["where the side-chain of the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile amide bond (the P1 position) is a large hydrophobic amino acid (tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine)", "digestive systems"]}

{"context": "Context: Based on a mark in an interior chamber naming the work gang and a reference to the fourth dynasty Egyptian Pharaoh Khufu, Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was built as a tomb over a 10- to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC. Initially at 146.5 metres (481 feet), the Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure in the world for more than 3,800 years. Originally, the Great Pyramid was covered by limestone casing stones that formed a smooth outer surface; what is seen today is the underlying core structure. Some of the casing stones that once covered the structure can still be seen around the base. There have been varying scientific and alternative theories about the Great Pyramid's construction techniques. Most accepted construction hypotheses are based on the idea that it was built by moving huge stones from a quarry and dragging and lifting them into place.\nEgyptologists believe the pyramid was built as a tomb for the Fourth Dynasty Egyptian pharaoh Khufu (often Hellenized as \"Cheops\") and was constructed over a 20-year period. Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid.[2] It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (146.5 metres (480.6 ft)), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is 138.8 metres (455.4 ft). Each base side was 440 cubits, 230.4 metres (755.9 ft) long. The mass of the pyramid is estimated at 5.9 million tonnes.

It first premiered on Canada on July 8, 2007 and June 5, 2008 on the United States. This season takes place at Camp Wawanakwa, a fictional island located somewhere in Muskoka, Ontario where the season is based on a summer camp theme (although a contestant is eliminated at the end of every episode). Like the whole series, this season is a competition to see which of the twenty-two contestants will survive and last the longest. This is because the contestants are brutally tortured along the way through the intense challenges they are given. Challenges are sometimes based on other reality shows like Fear Factor and Survivor. All of this is so that the winner of the season (the one to last the longest on the island and not get eliminated), will win a small fortune of C$100,000 and cheesy fame. Eliminated contestants are sent packing toward the Dock of Shame and must ride the Boat of Losers off the island.\n\n\n2\n\"Total Drama Action\"\n27\nTodd Kauffman / Mark Thornton\n15\nJanuary 11, 2009 (2009-01-11)\n\n\nTotal Drama Action is the second season of the series. It premiered on Canada on January 11, 2009 and June 10 in the U.S. It is a sequel to the first season of the series, Total Drama Island. In this season, fourteen characters from previous returned: Beth, Bridgette, DJ, Duncan, Geoff, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Justin, Leshawna, Lindsay, Owen, and Trent. Courtney returns later on in the season due to a lawsuit. In this season, the contestants are taken to a brand new location: an old film lot in the center of Toronto, Ontario. The challenges are now based on movie genres, and the grand prize is now C$1,000,000. Cody, Eva, Ezekiel, Noah, Katie, Sadie, and Tyler do not return to compete, but still appeared for the aftermath special, an extra show which was hosted by Bridgette and Geoff, the first two eliminated contestants. All losers must take the Walk of Shame on the red carpet and ride the Lame-o-sine.\n\n\n3\n\"Total Drama World Tour\"\n26\nKeith Oliver / Chad Hicks\n18\nJune 10, 2010 (2010-06-10)\n\n\nTotal Drama World Tour is the third season of the series. It premiered in 2010 internationally and continued onto 2011 in Canada. In this season, seventeen contestants are taken on a trip around the world as they compete in cultural themed challenges based on the countries or regions that they visit. An added twist in this season is that the contestants are required to break spontaneously into song, or else be immediately eliminated by Chris (although this rule was not strongly enforced, and no one was eliminated for not singing anyway). Fifteen of the original characters from previous returned: Bridgette, Cody, Courtney, DJ, Duncan, Ezekiel, Gwen, Harold, Heather, Izzy, Leshawna, Lindsay, Noah, Owen, and Tyler. Two new characters, Alejandro and Sierra, also joined the cast at the beginning of this season. Additionally, a third new character, Blaineley, was brought on to compete past the halfway point of the season. Beth, Eva, Geoff, Justin, Katie, Sadie, and Trent did not return to compete, but have instead appeared for the aftermath specials. The prize for this season is also C$1,000,000. People are eliminated by jumping off the Drop of Shame.\n\n\n4\n\"Total Drama: Revenge of the Island\"\n13[29]\nKeith Oliver / Chad Hicks\n13[26]\nJanuary 5, 2012 (2012-01-05)\n\n\nTotal Drama: Revenge of the Island is the fourth season of the series. The series' extension was commissioned by Teletoon from the producers, Fresh TV Inc.[25] It premiered in Canada on January 5, 2012 and in the United States on June 5, 2012. This season returns to Camp Wawanakwa (the original setting of the first season), but no contestants from previous seasons return. Instead, a new set of thirteen contestants compete, which are Anne Maria, B, Brick, Cameron, Dakota, Dawn, Jo, Lightning, Mike, Sam, Scott, Staci, and Zoey.[26] However, some characters from the original cast still have cameo appearances throughout the season.[27] Also, due to the island being abandoned for the past two seasons, Chris had lent the island to a biohazardous waste dump company, causing the island to turn radioactive.[28] This means that causes of radiation and toxic waste is the main theme for this season. This season only contains 13 episodes (half the length of a regular season),[29] and the cash prize is once again C$1,000,000. People are eliminated off the island by the Hurl of Shame.\n\n\n5\n\"Total Drama All-Stars and Pahkitew Island\"\n26[30]\nKeith Oliver / Chad Hicks\n28[36]\nJanuary 9, 2014 (2014-01-09)[8][21]\n\n\nTotal Drama All-Stars and Total Drama: Pahkitew Island both make up the fifth and most recent season of the Total Drama series which were ordered by Cartoon Network in October 2012 as 26 episodes.[30] Both parts of Season 5 feature different islands and casts, but share similar elements and are both under the same production code.\n\nTotal Drama All-Stars is the first part of the fifth and most recent season of the series.[31] While the season premiered on January 9, 2014 in Canada[21] and on September 10, 2013 in the United States.[22] This segment is 13 episodes long, just like the previous season.[32] Total Drama All-Stars features the fourteen most popular contestants from the previous two seasons,[30][33] which are: Alejandro, Cameron, Courtney, Duncan, Gwen, Heather, Jo, Lightning, Lindsay, Mike, Sam, Scott, Sierra, and Zoey.[34] They all compete in several \"Heroes vs. Villains\" themed challenges, which means that the protagonists (heroes) team up and compete against the antagonists (villains).[35] People will now be eliminated by taking the Flush of Shame and the winner once again takes home C$1,000,000.\n\nTotal Drama: Pahkitew Island is the second part of the fifth and most recent season and was announced on June 11, 2013.[8] It also consists of 13 episodes and takes place at a new location, this time on an island called Pahkitew Island located somewhere in Western Canada.[8] A new set of fourteen contestants compete in this season, which are: Amy, Beardo, Dave, Ella, Jasmine, Leonard, Max, Rodney, Samey, Scarlett, Shawn, Sky, Sugar, and Topher. The last part of this season first aired in the United States on July 7, 2014 and later in Canada on September 4, 2014.[7][23] Eliminations now take place via the Cannon of Shame and features another one million dollar grand prize. Pahkitew Island features various similar elements to Camp Wawanakwa but the island is much bigger and mostly artificial.\n\n\nThe Total Drama series is the original series of the greater Total Drama franchise, which consists of five seasons that have aired during a timeframe of seven years: the first season, Total Drama Island, the second season, Total Drama Action, the third season, Total Drama World Tour, the fourth season, Total Drama: Revenge of the Island, and the fifth season, titled as both Total Drama All-Stars and Total Drama: Pahkitew Island. The latest installment premiered on July 7, 2014, in the United States[7] and September 4, 2014, in Canada.[8] A spin-off series based on the main series, The Ridonculous Race, was produced shortly after the fifth season was aired.

{"context": "Context: In 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed from Spain on his first voyage with three ships, the Niña, the Pinta, and the flagship, Santa Maria, seeking a direct route to Asia. On 12 October 1492 Columbus reached an island in the Bahamas and claimed it for Spain, an event long regarded by Europeans as the 'discovery' of America. This island was called Guanahani by the Lucayan, and San Salvador by the Spanish. The identity of the first American landfall by Columbus remains controversial, but many authors accept Samuel E. Morison's identification of Columbus' San Salvador as what was later called Watling (or Watling's) Island. Its name has been officially changed to San Salvador. Columbus visited several other islands in the Bahamas before sailing to present-day Cuba and afterwards to Hispaniola.[3]\n\nQuestion: who explored waters of cuba the bahamas and hispaniola\nAnswer:", "answer": "Christopher Columbus", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The peripheral nervous system (PNS) is one of the two components of the nervous system, the other part is the central nervous system (CNS). The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.[1] The main function of the PNS is to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body.[2] Unlike the CNS, the PNS is not protected by the vertebral column and skull, or by the blood–brain barrier, which leaves it exposed to toxins and mechanical injuries. The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system. In the somatic nervous system, the cranial nerves are part of the PNS with the exception of the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), along with the retina. The second cranial nerve is not a true peripheral nerve but a tract of the diencephalon.[3] Cranial nerve ganglia originated in the CNS. However, the remaining ten cranial nerve axons extend beyond the brain and are therefore considered part of the PNS.[4] The autonomic nervous system is an involuntary control of smooth muscle and glands. The connection between CNS and organs allows the system to be in two different functional states: sympathetic and parasympathetic.\n\nQuestion: explain the function of the peripheral nervous system\nAnswer:", "answer": "to connect the CNS to the limbs and organs, essentially serving as a relay between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: By the late 1960s \"classic rock\"[1] period, a number of distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, raga rock, and jazz-rock, many of which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, which was influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended the artistic elements; glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style; and the diverse and enduring subgenre of heavy metal, which emphasized volume, power, and speed. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock. From the 1990s alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal, as well as conscious attempts to revisit rock's history, including the garage rock/post-punk and synth-pop revivals at the beginning of the 2000s.\n\nQuestion: a type of basic rock popular in the 1980s\nAnswer:", "answer": "alternative rock", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The dynasty was founded by the Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria. In the late sixteenth century, Nurhaci, originally a Ming vassal, began organizing \"Banners\", military-social units that included Jurchen, Han Chinese, and Mongol elements. Nurhaci formed the Jurchen clans into a unified entity, which he renamed as the Manchus. By 1636, his son Hong Taiji began driving Ming forces out of Liaodong and declared a new dynasty, the Qing. In 1644, peasant rebels led by Li Zicheng conquered the Ming capital, Beijing. Rather than serve them, Ming general Wu Sangui made an alliance with the Manchus and opened the Shanhai Pass to the Banner Armies led by the regent Prince Dorgon, who defeated the rebels and seized the capital. Resistance from the Southern Ming and the Revolt of the Three Feudatories led by Wu Sangui extended the conquest of China proper for nearly four decades and was not completed until 1683 under the Kangxi Emperor (r. 1661–1722). The Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor from the 1750s to the 1790s extended Qing control into Inner Asia. The early rulers maintained their Manchu ways, and while their title was Emperor, they used \"Bogd khaan\" to the Mongols and they were patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. They governed using Confucian styles and institutions of bureaucratic government and retained the imperial examinations to recruit Han Chinese to work under or in parallel with Manchus. They also adapted the ideals of the tributary system in dealing with neighboring territories.\n\nQuestion: where did the rulers of the qing dynasty originate\nAnswer:", "answer": "Jurchen Aisin Gioro clan in Manchuria", "aliases": ["Manchuria"]}

To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The Grim Reaper and the Greek Titan Cronus were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe.

{"context": "Context: In population dynamics and population ecology, overshoot occurs when a population temporarily exceeds the long term carrying capacity of its environment. The environment usually has mechanisms in place to prevent overshoot. For example, plants are only able to regenerate and regrow a few times after being consumed before completely dying off. [1] The consequence of overshoot is called a collapse, a crash or a die-off in which there is a decline in population density.

{"context": "Context: In the United States, where Fermi and Szilárd had both emigrated, this led to the creation of the first man-made reactor, known as Chicago Pile-1, which achieved criticality on December 2, 1942. This work became part of the Manhattan Project, a massive secret US government military project to make enriched uranium by building large reactors to breed plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons. The US tested atom bombs and eventually these weapons were used to attack the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nOn June 27, 1954, the USSR's Obninsk Nuclear Power Plant became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate electricity for a power grid, and produced around 5 megawatts of electric power.[50][51]\nThe United Kingdom, Canada,[46] and the USSR proceeded to research and develop nuclear industries over the course of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Electricity was generated for the first time by a nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the EBR-I experimental station near Arco, Idaho, which initially produced about 100 kW.[47][48] Work was also strongly researched in the US on nuclear marine propulsion, with a test reactor being developed by 1953 (eventually, the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine, would launch in 1955).[49] In 1953, US President Dwight Eisenhower gave his \"Atoms for Peace\" speech at the United Nations, emphasizing the need to develop \"peaceful\" uses of nuclear power quickly.

{"context": "Context: Cone cells, or cones, are one of three types of photoreceptor cells in the retina of mammalian eyes (e.g. the human eye). They are responsible for color vision and function best in relatively bright light, as opposed to rod cells, which work better in dim light. Cone cells are densely packed in the fovea centralis, a 0.3 mm diameter rod-free area with very thin, densely packed cones which quickly reduce in number towards the periphery of the retina. There are about six to seven million cones in a human eye and are most concentrated towards the macula.[1] The commonly cited figure of six million cone cells in the human eye was found by Osterberg in 1935.[2] Oyster's textbook (1999)[3] cites work by Curcio et al.

{"context": "Context: The Sun today is roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life. It has not changed dramatically for over four billion[a] years, and will remain fairly stable for more than five billion more. However, after hydrogen fusion in its core has stopped, the Sun will undergo severe changes, both internally and externally.\nThe Sun is about halfway through its main-sequence stage, during which nuclear fusion reactions in its core fuse hydrogen into helium. Each second, more than four million tonnes of matter are converted into energy within the Sun's core, producing neutrinos and solar radiation. At this rate, the Sun has so far converted around 100 times the mass of Earth into energy, about 0.03% of the total mass of the Sun. The Sun will spend a total of approximately 10 billion years as a main-sequence star.[133] The Sun is gradually becoming hotter during its time on the main sequence, because the helium atoms in the core occupy less volume than the hydrogen atoms that were fused. The core is therefore shrinking, allowing the outer layers of the Sun to move closer to the centre and experience a stronger gravitational force, according to the inverse-square law. This stronger force increases the pressure on the core, which is resisted by a gradual increase in the rate at which fusion occurs. This process speeds up as the core gradually becomes denser. It is estimated that the Sun has become 30% brighter in the last 4.5 billion years.[134] At present, it is increasing in brightness by about 1% every 100 million years.[135]\n\nQuestion: what stage of the star life cycle is the sun in\nAnswer:", "answer": "about halfway through its main-sequence stage", "aliases": ["roughly halfway through the most stable part of its life"]}

{"context": "Context: The Chinese character for umbrella is 傘 (sǎn) and is a pictograph resembling the modern umbrella in design. Some investigators have supposed that its invention was first created by tying large leaves to bough-like ribs (the branching out parts of an umbrella). Others assert that the idea was probably derived from the tent, which remains in an unaltered form to the present day. However, the tradition existing in China is that it originated in standards and banners waving in the air, hence the use of the umbrella was often linked to high-ranking (though not necessarily royalty) in China. On at least one occasion, twenty-four umbrellas were carried before the Emperor when he went out hunting. The umbrella served in this case as a defense against rain rather than sun. The Chinese design was later brought to Japan via Korea and also introduced to Persia and the Western world via the Silk Road. The Chinese and Japanese traditional parasol, often used near temples, remains similar to the original ancient Chinese design.\n\nQuestion: what was the ancient chinese umbrella used for\nAnswer:", "answer": "a defense against rain", "aliases": ["often linked to high-ranking (though not necessarily royalty) in China"]}

Atticus is assigned to defend him, and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins. Tom's left arm is crippled and useless, the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child. Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy, pointing out that the nature of Mayella's facial injuries strongly suggest a left-handed assailant. Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all-white, male jury. Despite Atticus' skilled defense, the jury's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty.

Earlier uses often included the type of vessel, as for instance \"U.S.F.\" (\"United States Frigate\") for frigates of the United States Navy, that were eliminated by President Theodore Roosevelt's Executive order of 1907 making \"United States Ship\" (USS) the standard for the Navy's commissioned ships while in commission.[1] In the United States Navy that prefix officially only applies while the ship is in active commission, with only the name used before or after a period of commission and for all vessels \"in service\" rather than commissioned status.[1] Today the common practice is to use a single prefix for all warships of a nation's navy, and other prefixes for auxiliaries and ships of allied services, such as coast guards.\n\n\n  Prefix\n  Meaning\n\n\nAE\nAmmunition ship\n\n\nAFS\nCombat stores ship\n\n\nAHT\nAnchor Handling Tug\n\n\nAHTS\nAnchor Handling Tug Supply vessel\n\n\nAO\nUnited States Navy oiler\n\n\nAOG\nGasoline tanker\n\n\nAOR\nAuxiliary, Replenishment Oiler\n\n\nAOT\nTransport Oiler\n\n\nATB\nArticulated Tug Barge\n\n\nCRV\nCoastal Research Vessel\n\n\nC/F\nCar Ferry\n\n\nCS\nCable Ship\n\n\nDB\nDerrick Barge\n\n\nDEPV\nDiesel Electric Paddle Vessel\n\n\nDLB\nDerrick Lay Barge\n\n\nDCV\nDeepwater Construction Vessel\n\n\nDSV\nDiving Support Vessel/ Deep Submergence Vehicle\n\n\nDV\nDead vessel[2][3]\n\n\nERRV\nEmergency Response Rescue Vessel[3]\n\n\nFPSO\nFloating Production, Storage and Offloading Vessel\n\n\nFPV\nFree Piston Vessel\n\n\nFPV\nFishery Protection Vessel\n\n\nFT\nFactory Stern Trawler\n\n\nFV\nFishing Vessel\n\n\nGTS\nGas Turbine Ship\n\n\nHLV\nHeavy lift vessel\n\n\nHSC\nHigh Speed Craft\n\n\nHSF\nHigh Speed Ferry\n\n\nHTV\nHeavy Transport Vessel\n\n\nIRV\nInternational Research Vessel\n\n\nITB\nIntegrated Tug barge\n\n\nLB\nLiftboat\n\n\nLNG/C\nLiquefied natural gas carrier\n\n\nLPG/C\nLiquefied petroleum gas carrier\n\n\nMF\nMotor Ferry\n\n\nMFV\nMotor Fishing Vessel (mainly UK Royal Naval Reserve)\n\n\nMS (M/S)\nMotor Ship (interchangeable with MV)\n\n\nMSV\nMultipurpose support/supply vessel\n\n\nMSY\nMotor Sailing Yacht\n\n\nMT\nMotor Tanker\n\n\nMTS\nMarine Towage and Salvage/Tugboat\n\n\nMV (M/V)\nMotor Vessel (interchangeable with MS)\n\n\nMY\nMotor Yacht\n\n\nNB\nNarrowboat\n\n\nNRV\nNATO Research Vessel\n\n\nNS\nNuclear Ship\n\n\nOSV\nOffshore supply vessel\n\n\nPS\nPaddle Steamer\n\n\nPSV\nPlatform Supply Vessel\n\n\nQSMV\nQuadruple Screw Motor Vessel\n\n\nQTEV\nQuadruple Turbo Electric Vessel\n\n\nRMS\nRoyal Mail Ship or Royal Mail Steamer\n\n\nRNLB\nRoyal National Lifeboat\n\n\nRV / RSV\nResearch Vessel\n\n\nSB\nSailing Barge\n\n\nSS (S/S)\nSingle-screw Steamship\n\n\nSD\nSerco Denholm (after the company which took over auxiliary maritime services for UK Naval Services in 2008, now Serco Marine Services)\n\n\nSSCV\nSemi-Submersible Crane Vessel\n\n\nSSS\nSea Scout Ship\n\n\nSSV\nSailing School Vessel, Submarine and Special Warfare Support Vessel[4]\n\n\nST\nSteam Tug or Steam Trawler\n\n\nSTS\nSail Training Ship\n\n\nSTV\nSail Training Vessel or Steam Turbine Vessel\n\n\nSV (S/V)\nSailing Vessel\n\n\nSY\nSailing Yacht or Steam Yacht\n\n\nTB\nTug boat\n\n\nTEV\nTurbine Electric Vessel\n\n\nTIV\nTurbine Installation Vessel\n\n\nTrSS\nTriple-Screw Steamship or steamer[5]\n\n\nTS\nTraining Ship or Turbine Steamship or Turbine steam ship\n\n\nTr.SMV\nTriple-Screw Motor Vessel\n\n\nTSMV\nTwin-Screw Motor Vessel[6]\n\n\nTSS\nTwin-Screw Steamship or steamer\n\n\nTST\nTwin-Screw Tug\n\n\nTV\nTraining vessel\n\n\nYD\nYard Derrick\n\n\nYW\nWater Barge, self-propelled\n\n\nYOS\nConcrete vessel\n\n\n\nQuestion: what does ss stand for on naval ships\nAnswer:", "answer": "\"United States Ship\" (USS)", "aliases": ["Single-screw Steamship"]}

It was filmed in Seattle, Washington, site of the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. The governor of Washington at the time, Albert Rosellini, suggested the setting to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer executives. The film made $2.25 million at the box office.[2]\nThe Seattle Center, including the Seattle Center Monorail and the Space Needle, serve as backdrops for several scenes in the film. Security officers pursue Presley and the girl through the fountains at what is now the Pacific Science Center. The hitchhiking scene with Elvis and Gary Lockwood was filmed near Camarillo, California, as were some of the flying scenes. The entire hitchhiking scene to the point where they are both picked up by Kam Tong and Vicky Tiu Cayetano in the truck is easily recognizable as 5th Street near Pleasant Valley Road on the South side of Camarillo.[3] While The Elvis Encyclopedia believes that the Wilburton Trestle was shown in the movie, further evidence points to a different location.[4] It is actually a trestle over the White River between Enumclaw and Buckley, now demolished. The view in the movie was taken at the intersection of Mud Mountain Road and Highway 410, looking southeasterly.[5] Mount Rainier is visible in the background, which isn't seen at that angle from the Wilburton Trestle.

In real life, they are hikikomori who are ostracized by the world. One day, they receive a challenge from Tet to a game of chess and are victorious. In response he offers to send them to a world which revolves around games and they accept, believing it to be a joke. They are then summoned to a reality known as Disboard where a spell, known as the Ten Pledges, prevents violence and enforces the rules and outcomes of games. They travel to Elkia, the nation inhabited by humans, where Sora plays poker against a woman for her money and wins by out-cheating her. He and Shiro rest at an inn and decide their next goal is to find a home. \n\n\n2\n\"Challenger\"\n\"Charenjā\" (挑戦者 (チャレンジャー)) \nMasaru Koseki\nJukki Hanada\nApril 16, 2014\n[73]\n\n\nStephanie Dola, granddaughter of Elkia's deceased king, loses against Kurami Zell in a contest to decide the next ruler; she then confronts Sora for not revealing how her opponent was cheating. Sora tricks her into a game of rock-paper-scissors and after winning, uses the Pledges to make her fall in love with him. Sora and Shiro then move into the palace with Stephanie where they learn more about world and decide to help Stephanie revitalize Elkia. \n\n\n3\n\"Expert\"\n\"Ekisupāto\" (熟練者 (エキスパート)) \nMasaki Hyuga\nJukki Hanada\nApril 23, 2014\n[74]\n\n\nDuring Kurami's coronation, Sora reveals she was using magic from the elf, Fil Nilvalen, to win her games. Kurami salvages the situation but is forced to play a game against Sora and Shiro. Originally, they believe the game is chess, but Sora deduces it is a war simulator with chess themed pieces; Sora's charisma rallies his army, giving them an advantage and forcing Kurami to cheat by corrupting Sora's soldiers. In return, Sora persuades Kurami's queen to join his army by declaring her king to be corrupt. \n\n\n4\n\"Grandmaster\"\n\"Gurandomasutā\" (国王 (グランドマスター)) \nChiaki Abe\nKeiko Yamamoto\nJukki Hanada\nApril 30, 2014\n[75]\n\n\nKurami's army begin defecting to her former queen; eventually her king is assassinated due to her tyrannical rule and Sora is victorious. Sora denounces Kurami's plan in assimilating humans with the elves, declaring humanity is stronger than she thinks. Sora and Shiro are crowned the king and queen of humanity and begin solving Elkia's political and economical problems. They later attend the formal coronation and receive humanity's race piece, a chess piece which represents humanity's rights and free-will. Tet visits Sora and Shiro and explains that whoever gathers all sixteen chess pieces, one for each species, will earn the right to challenge him for his title of god; in response Sora and Shiro accept his challenge, declaring they will be the winner. \n\n\n5\n\"Weak Square\"\n\"Wīku Sukuea\" (駒並べ (ウィークスクエア)) \nMaria Ichino\nTakashi Nagayoshi\nTakashi Aoshima\nMay 7, 2014\n[76]\n\n\nSora and Shiro leave Elkia's political responsibilities to Stephanie until she is challenged to a game by nobles who refuse the reform. She challenges Sora to blackjack in hopes of binding him to the Pledges to perform his duties; she attempts to use false shuffling but loses due to card counting. Understanding her predicament, Sora trumps the nobles and uses the previous game to have Stephanie act like a dog. Stephanie tries several more games on Sora to take responsibility as Elkia's king but fails. Sora and Shiro reveal they were not slacking, but are researching ways to conquer the other nations; in response Stephanie redirects them to Elkia's library which is owned by the flügel Jibril. \n\n\n6\n\"Interesting\"\n\"Intaresutingu\" (一手 (インタレスティング)) \nKunihiko Hamada\nKento Shimoyama\nMay 14, 2014\n[77]\n\n\nSora and Shiro challenge Jibril by betting their tablet computer full of books; considering it of high value, Jibril offers her freedom in exchange. They begin a game of materialization shiritori, where the words they use will materialize or disappear from the environment. From the game, Sora and Shiro deduce Disboard's scientific research is lacking, and uses this knowledge to their advantage; they succeed after removing coulomb's law and inducing a hypernova, removing Jibril from the game.

After investigating, Shiro recalls Sora arranged a game of reversi with Kurami; the game's pieces consist of the components making up Sora and Kurami's identity. Having lost most of his pieces, Sora was nearly erased from existence but the last three pieces allow Shiro to keep her memories of him. Shiro finds the pieces in her room and places them on an invisible board, winning the game and restoring Sora.

Sora and friends regroup as Shiro makes the proper adjustments to their plans. Executing the unspoken plan, Sora and Shiro corner Izuna, forcing her to use an ability called Blood Destruction to augment her abilities. \n\n\n12\n\"Rule Number 10\"\n\"Rūru Nanbā Jū\" (収束法 (ルール・ナンバー・10)) \nKōji Ōdate\nKunihiko Hamada\nJukki Hanada\nJune 25, 2014\n[50]\n\n\nSora and Shiro are defeated; as Izuna drops her guard, she is shot by Stephanie riding a NPC. Sora reveals he bound Stephanie to the Pledges to hide her intent while Shiro calculated the NPC's movements, allowing Stephanie to hide her location. While Izuna laments the werebeasts' fate, Sora assures her of his goodwill. Sora forces political pressure on the Eastern Federation leader, the nameless miko, to challenge him to a game. They have a coin flip where Sora has it land on its edge. He convinces the miko to declare they both win and as a result, Elkia can share resources with the Eastern Federation while the werebeasts maintain their self-rule; the allied nation is named the Elkia Federation.

{"context": "Context: The Church of England was legally established in the colony in 1619, and authorities in England sent in 22 Anglican clergyman by 1624. In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, in addition to the salary of the minister. There never was a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry consisting of laymen controlled the parish.[1]\nIn the 1740s, the established Anglican church had about 70 parish priests around the colony. There was no bishop, and indeed, there was fierce political opposition to having a bishop in the colony. The Anglican priests were supervised directly by the Bishop of London. Each county court gave tax money to the local vestry, composed of prominent laymen. The vestry provided the priest a glebe of 200 or 300 acres (1.2 km2), a house, and perhaps some livestock. The vestry paid him an annual salary of 16,000 pounds-of-tobacco, plus 20 shillings for every wedding and funeral. While not poor, the priests lived modestly and their opportunities for improvement were slim.\nThe history of religion in early Virginia begins with the commencing of Anglican services in Jamestown 1607, which became the established church in 1619, and culminates with the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom in 1786.\n\nQuestion: what was the religion in the virginia colony\nAnswer:", "answer": "Anglican church", "aliases": ["Anglican", "The Church of England"]}

Although the rivalry's significance arose from the two teams' numerous World Series meetings,[1] the Yankees and Dodgers have not met in the World Series since 1981.[1] They would not play each other in a non-exhibition game until 2004, when they played a 3-game interleague series.[2] Nevertheless, games between the two teams have become quite popular and draw sellout crowds.[3]\n\nQuestion: when was the last time the dodgers played yankees in the world series\nAnswer:", "answer": "1981", "aliases": []}

Caribou finds Tamago and Pekoms with his treasure that he stole and attacks Pekoms with his Gatling Gun. Pekoms reveals himself to be a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user. Caribou then attempts to slice off Pekom's head, saying that he was stronger because he was a logia-type devil fruit eater, only to get punched in the stomach by Pekoms, rendering him unconscious again. Pekoms and Tamago then leave Fishman island. It is later revealed that Smoker and Tashigi were reassigned to the G-5 Marine Branch, the most ruthless marine branch that don't even take orders from the HQ, and arrested a bunch of pirates emerging from Fishman Island, who tell Smoker that Luffy beat Hordy, with Smoker replying that he already knows and calls them idiots. \n\n\n573\n\"Finally Time to Go! Goodbye, Fish-Man Island!\"\n\"Tsui ni Shukkō! Sayonara Gyojin-tō\" (ついに出航! さよなら魚人島) \nNovember 18, 2012\n\n\nThe mermaids and Keimi from the Mermaid Cafe ask Sharley if they can say farewell to the Straw Hats. Sharley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hordy and the New Fishman Pirates. However, Keimi fears that Madam Sharley still believes that Luffy will destroy the Fishman Island because she knows that her predictions are always right. Shirahoshi meanwhile is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. While Minister of the Right talks to Neptune about mentioning the exploding tamate box to the Straw Hats, Neptune points out that Usopp, Brook, and Chopper complain that they are going to die in the New World and that they shouldn't tell them more bad news, later having optimistic ideas about how Big Mom might not open it herself or that the explosives might not explode. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. He explains that the new log pose takes in the magnetic waves of 3 surrounding islands and that the needle that moves the most is the direction of the most dangerous island. After hearing that, Nami, Chopper, and Usopp tell the Minister of the left to keep it down so Luffy doesn't hear, which he evidently does. He then grabs onto Nami wanting to see the new Log Pose and says to go in the direction of the needle that moves the most, stating, \"that's where the party is\". Nami insists that she will tell the crew where to go. However, Luffy states that he should decide where they should go, as he is the captain. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and they did. The Straw Hats and the fishmen go their separate ways and Luffy remembers the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jimbei, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World. \n\n\n574\n\"To the New World! Heading for the Ultimate Sea!\"\n\"Shin Sekai e! Saikyō no Umi o Mezashite\" (新世界へ! 最強の海をめざして) \nNovember 25, 2012\n\n\nThe Straw Hats are heading to the New World. Nami is taking a bath in the Thousand Sunny and Chopper comes in. Nami asks Chopper if he wants to join her in the bath and he says no claiming that he took one two days ago and the cloud reminds him of cotton candy. Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud. Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out. Luffy tells Usopp to hurry up with the fish hook because he wants to catch and eat a big fish. Robin says that Luffy and Usopp are having fun. Franky says he wants Cola with a big fish. Zoro says he wants to have a drink to celebrate entering the New World. Luffy, Zoro, and Usopp sees three big fish. Zoro wants to eat a fried fish with salt. Usopp wants a fish sliced up and grilled. Luffy wants a fish with mayonnaise. Usopp says which fish Luffy wants and claims that it is not edible. Luffy punches the fish with gear second and Usopp uses the fish hook to grab hold of it. The fish that they caught suddenly got ate by a bigger fish and Zoro uses 360 pound cannon killing it. Nami is still in the bath and she claims that the rest of the crew are making too much of a ruckus and that she shouldn't have trusted them in watching the ship for her. They suddenly got caught in a White Storm and Luffy claims it is the wormhole of his dreams and Usopp slaps him for saying that. Nami claims the crew to be stupid for getting into too much trouble while she was taking a bath. They get caught in the White Storm and they try to hang out to something so they won't fly out of the ship. They finally crash into a whale without noticing at first. Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World. They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines. \n\n\n575\n\"Z's Ambition! Lily the Little Giant!\"\n\"Zetto no Yabō Hen - Chiisana Kyojin Rirī!\" (Zの野望編 小さな巨人リリー!) \nDecember 2, 2012\n\n\nThere is a whole fleet of Neo Marine ships, one of which houses Ain and Bins. The Straw Hats fight back against a fleet of Marine ships, but it turns out to be a mirage. Huge raindrops appear out of nowhere, and the water suddenly splits. The Straw Hats wake up with different clothes. However, Sanji sees that the food he cooked is gone, so he blames it on Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper until Chopper wonders if the sea is haunted. Suddenly, the food begins to be eaten very quickly. Luffy finds the person who ate the food and it turns out to be a little girl. She attacks the Straw Hats and they fight back. It is then revealed that she ate the Mini Mini no Mi and that her name is Lily. She turns out to be a giant, though her devil fruit makes her small. She befriends the Straw Hats after they save her from drowning and wants to see her dad (this is why she invaded the Marine's fleet of ships). She then talks about food to Luffy. On the Neo Marines' ship, Ain calls Shuzo and asks why he was not there. Shuzo tells Ain that he will make a better second-in-command and that he is going after Lily's father. The Straw Hats see Marine ships coming their way who have Lily's father captive. They are heading towards Impel Down, so Luffy declares battle against the Marines. \n\n\n576\n\"Z's Ambition! A Dark and Powerful Army!\"\n\"Zetto no Yabō Hen - Nazo no Saikyō Gundan Tōjō!\" (Zの野望編 謎の最強軍団登場!) \nDecember 9, 2012\n\n\nNami creates a plan for the Straw Hats to rescue Lily's father, Panz Fry. Chopper, Robin, Brook, and Luffy are the diversion group while Usopp, Sanji, Zoro, and Lily are in the submarine. Luffy goes on the submarine because he finds the diversion group boring. They rescue Panz Fry, but Momonga attacks Luffy, forcing Zoro to intercept him. Shuzo attacks the marines and Panz Fry. His pet alpaca Alpacacino shoots out a cannon at the Marine ships. Shuzo attacks Panz Fry directly but is intercepted by Luffy. Shuzo then kicks Luffy into the sea. Zoro jumps into the water to save his captain, and Shuzo and Sanji get into an argument. Shuzo tells Momomga his reason why he quit the marines, much to the dismay of the rest of his crew. Luffy and Zoro then resurface and Luffy threatens Shuzo. Luffy and Momonga prepare to fight Shuzo. \n\n\n577\n\"Z's Ambition! A Great and Desperate Escape Plan!\"\n\"Zetto no Yabō Hen - Kesshi no Dai Dasshutsu Sakusen!\" (Zの野望編 決死の大脱出作戦!) \nDecember 16, 2012\n\n\nSeveral of Shuzo's men appear and fight against the Marines and easily begin to overwhelm them. Luffy continues to fight Shuzo while Zoro fights Momonga to which the Vice-admiral states they shouldn't interfere with their business like this. Zoro uses his 360 pound cannon and sends Momonga back that destroys a Marine ship. From the sidelines, Nami notices the wave changes in the ocean and realizes a Thrust-up Stream is coming. When Usopp asks what that is and asks if it's similar to the Knock-up Stream like the one that took them to Sky Island, Nami says it is, but smaller, but still has enough power to destroy a Marine ship. She has Franky fire the anchors to the raft Panz Fry and the others are on and lets Sanji and Lily know in advance. Luffy has a hard time against Shuzo's fighting style due to his long arms, but then starts using Haki to overwhelm Shuzo again. As Robin, Chopper, and Brook make their way back to the Sunny, several Thrust-up Streams take out some ships, one of the streams has Usopp in the Shark Submerge flying back to the ship. As Nami has everyone get on the ship she has Franky use a Coup de Burst after the raft everyone is one get close to the thrust and they fly away. However, Luffy and Zoro fall off due to the raft breaking and Luffy uses his arms to grab the raft while Shuzo uses a knife with a Vivre Card attached to it on the raft. After they get away, Momonga gathers his men on a broken ship and laments them having gotten away again while Shuzo goes to finish the Marines off with an attack and defeats Momonga. He then travels to the Straw Hats location and recalls his past fight with Ain and how their fight lasted for over five hours till she won, prompting their leader Z to give her the win and the title of next in command. Shuzo is determined to become the new next in command and destroy the pirates. The Straw Hats land in a location around some rocks and Robin notes they will be safe for now and Nami happy that the planned worked and that they finally got out of the sea. Chopper works on Panz Fry noting he had some bad injuries and that he'll be fine if he rests. Lily thanks Chopper for helping her father and the rest of the crew. Luffy is excited that he can try Panz Fry's cooking and Lily reveals she took some food from the Marines and while Zoro notes that's odd given the circumstances, he changes his tone after seeing she took some sake also. As Luffy asks Panz Fry to make some food, Sanji kicks him stating he needs to rest and Chopper says Luffy didn't listen. However, Panz Fry says he will cook for then despite Lily's protest stating that as a chef and Giant, he was saved by the crew and would shame himself if he didn't repay them for risking their lives and thanks Luffy for saving him and will cook the food. Shuzo arrives at the location and notes they are out of torpedoes and several of his men offer their lives to use as torpedoes, prompting Shuzo to acknowledge their sacrifice and say they are true men and state he will not let their deaths be for nothing. The ships then prepare to attack the Straw Hats. \n\n\n578\n\"Z's Ambition! Luffy vs. Shuzo!\"\n\"Zetto no Yabō Hen - Rufi tai Shūzo!\" (Zの野望編 ルフィVSシューゾ!) \nDecember 23, 2012\n\n\nShuzo orders his men to be launched at the island like torpedoes and sacrifice themselves for him. He then attacks Panz Fry and Lily. Luffy faces off against Shuzo but starts to be overpowered by Shuzo and Alpacacino. Lily attempts to go inside Shuzo to explode him by growing to full size, but he senses her intentions using Haki & uses Luffy as a shield so that she ends up inside Luffy instead. Lilly then takes advantage of the situation and turns Luffy into a giant with a combination of her ability and Luffy's rubbery form. Luffy defeats Shuzo and his pet alpaca and the group gets to eat the heavenly food from Panz Fry before parting ways with Lilly & Pans Fry and setting off for another adventure in the New World. Meanwhile, Ain is talking with Zephyr, where it is revealed to him that Shuzo lost. Ain takes the blame, but Zephyr does not care since neither Shuzo nor his men will tell the marines anything. Therefore, they begin their assault on the first island in the New World, which leads to Film Z. \n\n\n\nQuestion: what episode does luffy get to fishman island\nAnswer:", "answer": "Landing at the Fish-Man Island!

{"context": "Context: In political philosophy, limited government is where the government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution. It is a key concept in the history of liberalism. The United States Constitution presents an example of the federal government not possessing any power except what is delegated to it by the Constitution - with the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution specifically stating that powers not specifically delegated to the federal government is reserved for the people and the states. The Magna Carta and the United States Constitution also represents important milestones in the limiting of governmental power. The earliest use of the term limited government dates back to King James VI and I in the late 16th century.[1] Limited government put into practice often involves the protection of individual liberty from government intrusion.[2]\n\nQuestion: the main idea of limited government is that\nAnswer:", "answer": "governmental power is restricted by law", "aliases": ["government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution", "the government is empowered by law from a starting point of having no power, or where governmental power is restricted by law, usually in a written constitution", "protection of individual liberty from government intrusion"]}

{"context": "Context: In \"200\", it was revealed that JJ's transfer was a backstop and that she was actually put on a task force in the Middle East with Mateo Cruz (who later became the section chief of the BAU following Strauss's death). During this time, she witnessed a mission she had pushed for fail and discovered one of the task force's informants dead. In February 2011, while overseas, she discovered that she was pregnant. However, in April 2011, following the events of \"Lauren\", during an attack on the task force, she was wounded and miscarried the baby. She didn't initially tell Will of the pregnancy, and it remained a secret between her and Cruz. In \"The Forever People\", when she starts showing signs of PTSD, Reid calls her on it, and he tries to help her and talk to her. She eventually admits she had a miscarriage due to the attack on her convoy, and asks him to keep it between them.\nIn \"The Crossing\",[10] JJ told Will that she was pregnant with his child. He later asked her to marry him, and indicated that he was willing to give up his detective's shield in order to help take care of the baby and allow JJ to continue to do her job, though he was worried about her safety and the safety of their child.[11] JJ later told Hotch she had found a temporary replacement for the duration of her maternity leave,[12] and soon after gave birth to a baby boy named Henry. Will transfers to the MPDC, and the family live together in Washington.[13] In later seasons, toddler Henry is portrayed by actress A. J. Cook's real-life son Mekhai Andersen. JJ and Will named Reid and Technical Analyst Penelope Garcia as Henry's godparents. When JJ returned from maternity leave, she and Will had exchanged rings with Henry's birthstone, but did not seem to be officially engaged, as she wore her ring on her right hand, not the left. In the season seven finale, JJ tearfully asked Will to propose to her again, and they married the following evening in a small ceremony in David Rossi's backyard.\n\nQuestion: criminal minds what episode does jj find out she pregnant\nAnswer:", "answer": "The Crossing", "aliases": ["in April 2011"]}
{"context": "Context: The letter was written to the church at Philippi, one of the earliest churches to be founded in Europe. They were very attached to Paul, just as he was very fond of them. Of all the churches, their contributions (which Paul gratefully acknowledges) are among the only ones he accepts. (Acts 20:33–35; 2 Cor. 11:7–12; 2 Thess. 3:8). The generosity of the Philippians comes out very conspicuously (Phil. 4:15). \"This was a characteristic of the Macedonian missions, as 2 Cor. 8 and 9 amply and beautifully prove. It is remarkable that the Macedonian converts were, as a class, very poor (2 Cor. 8:2), though the very first converts were of all classes (Acts 16); and the parallel facts, their poverty and their open-handed support of the great missionary and his work, are deeply harmonious.\" (Moule).\nThe Epistle of Paul to the Philippians, often referred to simply as Philippians, is the eleventh book in the New Testament. Paul and Timothy first visited Philippi in Greece during Paul's second missionary journey, which occurred between approximately 49 and 51 AD.

{"context": "Context: Habib (Arabic: حبيب‎, translit. ḥabīb; Arabic pronunciation: [ħabiːb ]), sometimes written as Habeeb, is an Arabic masculine given name and occasional surname with the meaning \"beloved\".[1] The name is popular throughout the Muslim World, though particularly in the Middle East and Africa. In other countries, especially in Yemen and Southeast Asian countries such as Brunei, Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, it is an honorific to address a Muslim scholar of Sayyid (a descendant of Muhammad) families. It is important to note that the name, as is the case with other Arabic names, is not confined to Muslims. Notable examples of Christian individuals named Habib include 'Habib the Deacon'[2] and Gabriel Habib[3] and the Philosopher Habib.[4]\n\nQuestion: what is the meaning of the name habib\nAnswer:", "answer": "beloved", "aliases": ["\"beloved\""]}

The ceremony was televised in the United States by American Broadcasting Company (ABC), produced by Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd and directed by Glenn Weiss.[5] Comedian Jimmy Kimmel hosted for the second consecutive year, making him the first person to host back-to-back ceremonies since Billy Crystal in 1997 and 1998.[6]\n\nQuestion: where will the oscars be held this year\nAnswer:", "answer": "Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California", "aliases": ["the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California", "at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California"]}

{"context": "Context: Daenerys Targaryen (season 1–present) portrayed by Emilia Clarke. Daenerys Targaryen is the exiled princess of the Targaryen dynasty. Also called \"the Stormborn\", she and her brother Viserys were smuggled to Essos during the end of Robert's Rebellion. For seventeen years, she has been under the care of Viserys, whom she fears, as he is abusive to her whenever she displeases him. In exchange for an army, Viserys marries her to the powerful Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, making her a Khaleesi, a queen of the Dothraki. Daenerys is at first afraid of her new husband but after learning the Dothraki language, she manages to get past their barriers. She begins to understand him and genuinely falls in love with him after learning Drogo is an intelligent leader and a kind man. After embracing the Dothraki culture, she becomes stronger and rebels against her brother. She later becomes pregnant with Drogo's son who is prophesied by the Dothraki to be the \"Stallion Who Mounts the World\". After her brother's death and an assassination attempt by Robert Baratheon, Drogo vows to Daenerys that he will conquer the Seven Kingdoms for her and their unborn son. However, during their journey Drogo suffers from blood poisoning due to an infected wound incurred during a fight with a Dothraki tribesman. Daenerys is forced to seek the help of healer Mirri Maz Duur to save his life using blood magic. Mirri tricks Daenerys by using her unborn son's life as a sacrifice to heal Drogo, leaving him in a permanent catatonic state, and forcing Daenerys to end her husband's life. Losing both her husband and son, Daenerys punishes Mirri by having her burnt at the stake. She also lays the three dragon eggs she received as a wedding gift onto Khal Drogo's body, then steps into the burning funeral pyre. After the fire extinguishes itself, the Khaleesi and three baby dragons, named Drogon, Rhaegal, and Viserion, are found alive and unharmed. Daenerys takes the baby dragons and the remaining tribe to gather new allies and reclaim the Iron Throne. She becomes the first female Dothraki leader. In Season 2, she is lost in the Red Waste, a stretch of barren land. She and her khalasar eventually make it to Qarth, where the nobles are more interested in her dragons than her conquering Westeros. When her dragons are stolen by Pyat Pree, she goes into the House of the Undying and retrieves them, killing Pyat Pree. In the second season's finale, she imprisons her host Xaro Xoan Daxos for having helped Pyat Pree. Her horde loot Xaro's mansion to buy a ship. Daenerys travels from Qarth to Astapor, a city in Slaver's Bay, where she negotiates the purchase of elite eunuch soldiers called the Unsullied. She also meets the famed knight Ser Barristan Selmy, and accepts him into her queensguard. On her departure from the city, she frees the slaves and has Drogon torch its elders. By the end of Season 3, although her power has not yet been tested, she has acquired the loyalty of tens of thousands of freed slaves from Astapor and Yunkai, her remaining Dothraki brethren (and two former Westerosi soldiers whom she encountered through the Dothraki, who advise her) 2,000 'Second Sons' cavalrymen, 8,000 'Unsullied' elite infantry, and three rapidly growing dragons. The stay in Slaver's Bay has made her question her motives, however, and she takes up the cause of ending slavery as well, donning the honorific \"Breaker of Chains\" as the slaves hold her to the sky, praising her as their Mhysa, or \"Mother\". Daenerys later frees the slaves from Meereen, the last of the slave cities in Slaver's Bay, but realizes that she is slowly losing control of her dragons, especially when Drogon shows signs of aggression towards her when she tries to break up a fight between them over food. Aware that she does not have enough men to conquer Westeros just yet, Daenerys resolves to remain in Slaver's Bay and rule as Queen for the time being. She eventually learns of Jorah's original purpose, which was to spy on her for Robert Baratheon, and orders him to leave Meereen on threat of execution. After she receives too many complaints about her dragons, Daenerys, locks Rhaegal and Viserion of them in the catacombs beneath Meereen before searching for Drogon. Meanwhile, Daenerys faces a new threat to her rule in the form of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance movement against her and the Unsullied. She considers freeing her dragons, but they attempt to attack her, making her realize that they are no longer loyal to her. After Daario and Grey Worm arrest a member of the Sons of the Harpy, Mossador implores Daenerys to execute their captive, but Barristan tells her of the Mad King's actions against his enemies, which included burning them with wildfire while laughing. He asks her not to execute the captive without a fair trial, and she agrees with him. Mossador goes against her wishes, and kills the captive Son of the Harpy. Daenerys has him publicly executed, which leads a riot to break out between the old masters and the freed slaves. At night, Daenerys finds that Drogon has returned, but when she tries to touch his face, he flies away. Soon afterward, a group of Unsullied patrolling the streets of Meereen are stopped by a crying woman who points them to an alleyway. The Unsullied head in to investigate, but it is revealed that the entire affair was a set up after they are soon cornered by a group of the Sons of the Harpy. The Unsullied attempt to fight back, but the Sons of the Harpy kill many of them. Barristan Selmy sees the commotion and tries to help, killing many of the Sons of the Harpy, but gets badly wounded, and dies. Grey Worm also sustains serious but nonfatal injuries. Daenerys is furious after learning what has happened to Barristan, and rounds up the leaders of the great Meereenese houses. She takes them into the catacombs where she randomly has one of them shoved forward. The Meereenese lord is promptly killed by dragonfire from Rhaegal, and he and Viserion eat him. Daenerys then has all the lords arrested, including her former adviser Hizdahr zo Loraq, whom she decides to marry to win over the Meereenese nobles. To respect the culture of the region, she agrees to have the fighting pits reinstated (she had previously declined due to her distaste for killing for sport). Hizdahr convinces Daenerys to go to one of the pits to see the contestants battling over who will go to the final competition. Daenerys is sickened by the bloodshed, and gets up to leave, but her attention is turned by one masked competitor who defeats all of the other competitors without killing any of them. This competitor turns out to be Jorah Mormont, who is trying to win over Daenerys' favor after being banished. Daenerys orders the Unsullied to take him away, but Jorah announces that he has brought her a gift, and Tyrion Lannister reveals himself to Daenerys. After a round of questioning, Daenerys banishes Jorah once again, but takes Tyrion on as her adviser. On the great opening of Daznak's Pit, Jorah resurfaces as a voluntary contender on the arena, but Daenerys refuses to stop the games to spare his life. Jorah eventually prevails and saves her life by impaling with his spear an attacker from the Sons of the Harpy, who appear in legions and attack Daenerys' guards. Cornered at the midst of the arena, defeat seems immediate when Drogon returns, killing many Sons of the Harpy despite being wounded by several of their spears. Daenerys manages to rekindle their bond and climbs his back, riding off into the distance to a stunned crowd. She roams the Great Steppe north of the city, where Drogon seems reluctant to obey her commands or even hunt for food. Strolling about on her own, Daenerys is faced with an incoming Dothraki khalasar of great numbers, and after dropping a ring to the ground to leave a trail, she is surrounded. In season 6, the Dothraki take her to Vaes Dothrak, where she identifies herself to Khal Moro as Drogo's former wife. Out of respect for Dothraki traditions, they take Daenerys to join the Dosh Khaleen, which consisted of the wives of deceased khals. Daenerys refuses and instead burns the temple down with herself and all the khals still inside. She emerges unscathed, and the awed Dothraki accept her as their new leader. She returns to Meereen with her new army and destroys the slaver fleet assaulting the city with her dragons. In the aftermath, Daenerys meets with Theon and Yara Greyjoy, who offer their support for her claim so that they can overthrow their uncle Euron. Daenerys accepts their aid and secures help from the Reach and Dorne, names Tyrion as her hand, but breaks up with Daario, ordering him to stay behind and govern Slaver's Bay in her absence. With her new army, Daenerys finally sets sail for Westeros. In Season 7 Daenerys finally uses her dragons in battle, annihilating a Lannister force and their baggage train with fire. Daenerys welcomes Jon Snow to Dragonstone, seeing him as a friend and ally, insisting that he bend the knee to her but exhibiting patience with his refusal. She believes his tales of white walkers and agrees to let him mine dragonglass (obsidian) from her land. When Jon's expedition north of the Wall gets into trouble Daenerys takes her dragons to rescue them, and is devastated when the Night King kills one. On the ship back to Dragonstone she and Jon make love.\n\nQuestion: who plays the dragon queen from game of thrones\nAnswer:", "answer": "Emilia Clarke", "aliases": []}

Boruto is quickly caught by Shikamaru, who remarks that Boruto and Naruto are very similar, being father and son, which Boruto resents (Shikamaru makes a similar comment about Shikadai and himself). Sarada wonders how Sasuke would be as a father since she was very young when he left the village and has not seen him much since. She asks Sakura if Sasuke needed glasses when he was a child, and Sakura's vague answer does little to satisfy Sarada. Sarada decides to look into the Uchiha clan, learning about the Sharingan and how she and her father are the clan's last living members; when she tries to do further research in regard to her father, she discovers that the information is restricted from public access. Sarada approaches her mother again and asks her if she even is Sasuke's wife. Out of anger, Sakura breaks the ground with a punch, but then she apologizes to Sarada for raising her voice and reassures her that Sasuke's feelings are connected with hers. Sakura subsequently faints upon seeing their house become demolished from the blow. In an effort to find their family portrait amid the ruins of the house, Sarada discovers that Sasuke's picture is that of a larger one featuring Karin, Suigetsu, and Jugo. Sarada notices that Karin wears glasses very similar to hers, which further fuels her doubt about her relationship to her mother. With Sakura in the hospital to recover from the stress, Sarada asks Shizune if she is in fact the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura. Shizune confirms this but becomes just as vague as Sakura when pressed by Sarada for more information. Sarada and Chocho run into each other at a restaurant, with Chocho revealing that she does not believe she is related to her parents and expressing her desire to travel in order to find her real ones. Sarada is inspired by the idea and resolves to track Sasuke down and make him tell her everything. In an unknown location, Sasuke emerges from a portal. He quickly finds himself attacked by an unknown assailant and activates his Sharingan. \n\n\n20\n\"The Boy with the Sharingan\"\n\"Sharingan no Shōnen\" (写輪眼の少年) \nAugust 16, 2017\n\n\nThe mysterious person attacks Sasuke and gets defeated by him.

There, she meets Chocho, who also plans to go on a journey to find her real father. Naruto departs and Sarada tries to chase after him but is left behind because Chocho falls halfway. Boruto comes to deliver a lunch box to Naruto but arrives late, and Sarada asks him to let her deliver the lunch box in his place. He initially refuses but later agrees because she keeps asking him persistently. Afterwards, when Sarada and Chocho are going after Naruto, the person who attacked Sasuke earlier gets in their way, introduces himself as Shin Uchiha and asks Sarada to come with him. She refuses to go with him and he attacks them, but Naruto comes to save them and fights him using his Tailed Beast form, much to everyone's surprise. Shin then retreats from there after acknowledging that he cannot win against Naruto. Sarada is worried after the incident, and Naruto assures her that he will protect her. Sarada delivers the lunch box, and Naruto decides to take them with himself for their safety. They eat their lunch, and after that Naruto tells them about how he sees Sasuke as his rival and how Sarada's appearance resembles Sasuke's, while her presence resembles Sakura's, such as her scary attitude when she gets mad. They continue their journey, and just when they are about to reach the tower where Naruto arranged to meet up with Sasuke, Chocho gets tired and Naruto tells Sarada to rest for a few moments, but she makes an excuse and goes to meet Sasuke without Naruto and Chocho. Her eyes transform into the Sharingan because of her strong desire to meet her father, and when she gets inside the tower, Sasuke points out his sword at her because, after seeing her Sharingan, he thinks that Sarada is with the person who attacked him. \n\n\n21\n\"Sasuke and Sarada\"\n\"Sasuke to Sarada\" (サスケとサラダ) \nAugust 23, 2017\n\n\nShizune informs Sakura that Sarada has left the village after seeing the picture with team Taka to meet Sasuke with Naruto.

At the tower, Sasuke pierces his sword into a pillar behind Sarada and tries to grab her, but he recognizes her after she calls him \"dad\". Naruto shows up with Chocho, and Sasuke angrily asks him why he brought kids along, but Sarada tells him that she purposely followed Naruto to meet him, as she wants to know whether Sakura is her real mother. Meanwhile, Shizune gets to know from Sakura that Sarada has awakened her Sharingan a long time ago. Sakura informs Shizune that she does not want Sarada to find out her father was an enemy of Konoha in the past, this being the reason why she did not tell her about the others in the photo with team Taka. Sarada complains to Sasuke that he has never been around and that her mother never tells her anything. Sarada asks Sasuke about the woman in the picture (Karin) and his reason for abandoning his family for so long, but he replies simply that she has nothing to do with it. After hearing his answer, she cries out and leaves the tower, and Naruto asks Sasuke if it would not be better to let her know about the reason behind his absence. Both reminisce about the time when Sasuke left Konoha in order to stay vigilant in case a threat similar to Kaguya came, as such a menace would bring global harm. Back then, Sasuke decided to keep his mission a secret, even at the cost of his daughter's possible future resentment. Naruto then leaves the tower and tries to comfort Sarada. Later, a mysterious person talks to Shin about his plan to revive Akatsuki and prepares to attack everyone at the tower along with several people who look like Shin. That person uses blades to attack Naruto, who foils the attack using Kurama's chakra. Then, Sasuke joins the fight and tries to defeat the enemy using Fire Style. The enemy uses Shin as a shield. He then introduces himself as Shin Uchiha and tells everyone present about his plan to revive Akatsuki using Sasuke's Sharingan. Sasuke asks Naruto to protect Sarada and decides to fight Shin alone. As Sasuke is about to attack him, Sasuke's sword suddenly pierces Naruto, as Shin explains that this is his Dōjutsu (Visual Prowess). Accordingly, Sasuke realizes that Shin marked his sword in their fight earlier. Because of Naruto's injury, Kurama's chakra fades, and Shin attacks Sarada with his blades, but Sasuke comes in their way to protect her, injuring himself in the process. Shin stops Sasuke's movements through the blades piercing Sasuke's body. Shin moves to take Sasuke's Sharingan, but Sakura suddenly appears and defeats the enemy with a single punch. Sarada stands surprised at former Team 7's resilience and power, realizing that even Naruto's injury has already started healing. Sakura hugs Sarada and apologizes to Sasuke for not making things more clear to their daughter, but Sasuke tells her that it is his fault. Naruto grabs both older and younger Shin and drags them toward himself. As they are about to get near Naruto, Shin's mysterious creature begins teleporting Shin and Sarada to his place, but Sakura pushes her daughter out of the way and is teleported instead of her. Sakura then ends up in Shin's hideout and finds herself surrounded by more of his sons. \n\n\n22\n\"Connected Feelings\"\n\"Tsunagaru Omoi\" (つながる想い) \nAugust 30, 2017\n\n\nIn order to find Sakura, Sasuke and Naruto decide to go to Orochimaru's hideout to ask for information regarding Shin's location. Naruto tells Sarada that there is a chance she will meet the people in the picture there. Meanwhile, in his hideout, Shin explains to Sakura that human beings are bounded by their genes and are simple vessels. He also mentions how Akatsuki enables the stronger genes to thrive through battles and helps the formation of new Jutsu. On their way to Orochimaru's hideout, Naruto and Sasuke meet Captain Yamoto, who is on surveillance over Orchimaru. After getting into the hideout, they meet Sasuke's former teammates - Suigetsu and Jugo, who are the current caretakers of the hideout. Then, Orochimaru appears and meets them with a new, younger appearance. After hearing Shin's name from Sasuke, he takes them to another chamber and explains that Shin Uchiha is one of his old experiments that was used for the right arm of Danzo. Shin has a unique ability of being transplanted to or injected with anything without any side effects. He also explains why Shin refers to himself as Uchiha, the reason being that he can manifest the Sharingan and is obsessed with the Uchiha name, in particular with Sasuke's brother, Itachi. On their way out, Sarada asks Suigetsu if he knows the lady in the picture, and he identifies her as Karin. After hearing this, Sarada asks if she is in the hideout, to which Suigetsu replies that she is in another one. Then, Sarada reveals her doubts about her parentage, shocking Suigetsu and making him ask himself if her suspicions could ever be possible. In order to take a DNA test, Suigetsu takes a DNA sample from Sarada and uses what he thinks is Karin's umbilical cord. The result shows that there is a perfect match, making Suigetsu assume that Karin is Sarada's mom. Because of this, Sarada feels lied to and fooled by her mother. Realizing how Sarada feels, Suigetsu runs out of the room to prevent further problems. Naruto sees Sarada crying and comes to her. After Sarada manifests the Sharingan, Naruto shows Sarada her eyes in a mirror. He then tells her to calm down and tries to comfort her, but Sarada tells him that he has nothing to do with her and that he cannot understand how she feels. Naruto says he is the Hokage and the entire village is his family, which also includes Sarada. Naruto also tells her that the bonds between a parent and a child are not just based on history and blood relations but on the love between them, and he asks Sarada if she can remember any moments that show the love between her and Sakura. Sarada does this and thinks of several such instances, which depict how Sakura was taking care of Sarada when she was sick, how she reassured her about Sasuke's love for both of them and how she poked her forehead. After remembering all of these moments, Sarada becomes willing to go and save her mother from Shin Uchiha. After both of them leave the room, Suigetsu gets frightened and hides so that Sarada cannot see him. Orochimaru comments that Sakura might be dead already, to which Sasuke replies that his wife is not weak. Sasuke then says that his Visual Prowess is recovered and he will take everyone to the hideout in his Susanoo. Sarada and Chocho are amazed by his abilities. In the hideout of Shin Uchiha, Shin plans to revive Akatsuki by killing Sasuke and taking his Sharingan, as he thinks Sasuke is not worthy of the Uchiha name. \n\n\n23\n\"Bonds Come in All Shapes\"\n\"Tsunagari no Katachi\" (つながりのカタチ) \nSeptember 6, 2017\n\n\nAs Naruto and the others are coming to save Sakura, she starts fighting Shin after gaining enough information about his evil intentions of reviving Akatsuki. Meanwhile, Naruto and the others get confronted by Shin's clones upon their arrival at the hideout. Sarada rushes to save Sakura and Sasuke goes after her, while Naruto faces Shin's clones alone. Shin attacks Sakura with his blades and successfully pierces two blades into her arm, restricting Sakura's movement. Afterwards, Shin tries to kill Sakura with a giant shuriken, but Sasuke interrupts him and immediately helps Sakura, much to Sarada's enjoyment. He then goes after Shin, who lost his right leg, but a clone of Shin gets in his way. Instead, Shin stabs Sasuke along with his clone. After Sasuke and Sakura briefly look at each other, Sakura runs to the opposite direction of Shin, who sends his blades after her, but Sasuke changes places with Sakura using his Rinnegan and she finally defeats Shin with a single punch. After that, the clones fighting Naruto come near Shin, but instead of saving him, they stab him with their weapons. They tell him that they are just following Shin's principles, as his Visual Prowess is no longer powerful, and they believe that it is their turn to get to evolve. Then, several other clones made by the clones themselves come and start fighting Naruto and Sasuke. Shin tries to teleport himself along with Sakura between all the commotion, but Sarada stops him by punching his mysterious creature who has just begun teleporting them, thus showing that she inherited Sakura’s natural control over chakra, much to Sasuke's pride and Sakura's surprise. The clone fighting Naruto stops after seeing Kurama inside Naruto, and Naruto promises that they will not attack them if they behave. Sakura hugs Sarada and Sasuke tells Sarada that her existence in the world is the proof of his and Sakura's connected feelings. Afterwards, all the clones are sent to the orphanage that is run by Kabuto, and upon returning to the village, Chocho sees Choji in his slim form for the first time in her life and her quest to find her real father ends. At Orochimaru's hideout, Karin explains to Suigetsu that Sarada really is Sasuke and Sakura's daughter. She scolds Suigetsu for the mistake he made, as she was just the midwife for Sakura when Sakura went into labour, and tells him that the umbilical cord he used for the test is actually the one between Sakura and Sarada. She then urges him to go and apologize to Sarada. Sakura confirms to Sarada along with Sasuke that she is their biological child at the dining table. Next day, Sarada and Sakura see Sasuke off as he leaves for his mission. Before departing, Sasuke pokes Sarada's forehead and, remembering this gesture from her mother, Sarada turns to Sakura and smiles happily. At the academy, Sarada tells Boruto that she wants to become Hokage in the future. \n\n\n24\n\"Boruto and Sarada\"\n\"Boruto to Sarada\" (ボルトとサラダ) \nSeptember 13, 2017\n\n\nKonoha hosts a summit between the Five Kage, during which Boruto tries to deface his father's statue once again. Sarada and Sakura place their newly taken family photo in their new home. After this, with her Sharingan now fully unlocked, Sarada trains with Chocho to become Hokage, but she explains that, on her mother's advice, she plans to keep her new power a secret to avoid being targeted in the future. Konohamaru teaches Sarada more about the Sharingan and tells her she is now his rival toward becoming Hokage. During the summit, Naruto reveals that Sasuke has been using his Rinnegan to investigate the other dimensions and fears that one of them may be harboring dangerous threats. While the other Kage express concern that the new generation of ninja are not cut out for taking on threats should they be faced with a new war, Naruto reveals his belief that the new generation will manage to surpass them. \n\n\n25\n\"A Turbulent Field Trip!!\"\n\"Haran no Shūgakuryokō!!\" (波乱の修学旅行!!) \nSeptember 20, 2017\n\n\nWith last week’s fear of war still hanging in the air, Naruto hopes to improve relations with the Land of Water by sending his village’s students on a field trip to their Hidden Village. Principal Iruka concurs, and before they know it the students are on a cruise ship en route to the Hidden Mist. To the surprise of the students the Mist has been completely modernized, perhaps even more so than the Leaf, and seeing their amazement in the midst of a different village and culture is undoubtedly entertaining. In typical anime fashion, the girls are charmed by the foreign boys, while the boys are more interested in games and movies. \n\n\n26\n\"The Mizukage's Successor\"\n\"Mizukage no Kōkeisha\" (水影の後継者) \nSeptember 27, 2017\n\n\nLast week’s instructive foray into the Hidden Mist extends into a class visit to the office of the new Mizukage, Chojuro. Boruto quickly tires of Chojuro’s speech about unity between the villages, which the Kage mercifully cuts short. Kagura continues the Kage’s story later, explaining that Chojuro is the reason for the Mist Village’s recent prosperity. Kagura takes some time to reflect on the “Blood Mist’s” dark past, which triggers a rather pertinent outburst from Iwabe. Iwabe tells a story about his grandfather being killed by the Fourth Mizukage, making a point that the Mist should not be so quick to write off their violent history when the war is still fresh in the minds of their victims. \n\n\n27\n\"A Shinobi Bout of Friendship\"\n\"Yūjō no Shinobi Bauto\" (友情のシノビバウト) \nOctober 4, 2017\n\n\nWith Kagura's help, Boruto and his friends manage to save Denki from the Kirigakure's ninjas led by Hachiya. After this, Kagura confesses to the others that he is the grandson of the 4th Mikuzage, Yagura, and is afraid of wielding his sword which once almost controlled himself to kill his mates. Meanwhile, Shino, Anko and Mei discuss the issues between Kirigakure and the Land of the Water that could create another war. As the Konohagakure boys befriend Kagura, they wonder why did Hachiya take such methods. Happy with having obtained friends, Kagura informs the Mizukage Chojuro. \n\n\n28\n\"A Declaration of War!\"\n\"Sensen Fukoku\" (宣戦布告) \nOctober 11, 2017\n\n\nKagura decides to become one of the Seven Ninja Swordsman of Mist, so he starts practicing with the Hiramekarei sword. Boruto comes to meet him as he calls Boruto to show him the Hiramekarei sword. Boruto congratulates Kagura and assures him that he will become a good leader of the village. As Boruto is praising Kagura, someone suddenly captured them using Water Style. He then release them and Kagura calls him Shizuma. Shizuma tells them his plan to start another war by killing Boruto. Kagura tries to change his mind but instead he makes Kagura reminisce the time when he tried to kill a student at the academy, and Shizuma stopped him. He tells Kagura that the present Mizukage is hiring assassins to kill those who oppose him. After that, Boruto starts fighting Shizuma and when he tries his Lightning Style against him, his subordinates show up to help Shizuma in killing Boruto. Boruto gets pass through his subordinates using a new technique but Shizuma easily defeats him. Kagura saves him from drowning into the water, and Shizuma tells Boruto that he and the others are Seven Ninja Swordsman of Mist and Kagura is also one of them. He then orders Kagura to kill Boruto but instead he points out his sword at Shizuma. Kagura then agrees to join the Shizuma's group and asks to spare Boruto's life. Kagura leaves with the others and Boruto faints because of his injuries. When he wakes up, Sarada tells him that Hachiya told her about him. He apologizes to Boruto for his earlier actions. Suigetsu is shown in Kirigakure reveling Shizuma's full name Shizuma Hoshigaki. He then disappears as soon as Mitsuki shows up. Boruto asks Hachiya about the relation between Kagura and Shizuma, and he tells Boruto that Kagura feels indebted to Shizuma because he hurt him in the past. Sarada plans to tell the teachers about it, but Boruto stops her because he wants to save Kagura himself. Sarada agrees on the condition that he will let her go with him. \n\n\n29\n\"The New Seven Ninja Swordsmen!\"\n\"Shin·Shinobigatana Shichininshū!!\" (新·忍刀七人衆！！) \nOctober 18, 2017\n\n\nBoruto and Sarada convince Chojuro to help them take down Shizuma's gang and save Kagura, but they quickly find out that the \"New Seven Swordsmen of the Mist\" are not to be trifled with. Sarada is hit by an explosive attack that drops her through a deep hole into a cave, where she is confronted by Buntan Kurosaki, who wields the sword Kiba. Sarada's absence leaves Boruto and Chojuro as the only two remaining to take on Shizuma and the other five. Suigetsu confronts Mitsuki and warns him not to let his origins be revealed by saving Boruto. Shikadai and Inojin eavesdrop on Suigetsu and Mitsuki but are quickly discovered and recruited by Mitsuki to help take down Shizuma. \n\n\n30\n\"The Sharingan vs. The Lightning Blade, Kiba the Fang!\"\n\"Sharingan vs Raitō Kiba\" (写輪眼vs (バーサス)雷刀·牙) \nOctober 25, 2017\n\n\nAs Buntan begins pressuring Sarada with her array of Lightning Release techniques augmented by the Kiba, Sarada manages to hold her own with her Sharingan. Buntan voices both her excitement and disdain at facing the Sharingan, seeing it as not only an unfair lineage trait but also a shortcut to power. Sarada retorts that Buntan stole the Kiba, but Buntan insists that she earned them and proved to be her father's child by more than just lineage. As the two continue to clash, with Sarada continuously copying her opponent's attacks, the Konoha-nin realizes that their constant lightning attacks are heating the water around them and creating a mist. Sarada lures Buntan into the mist with genjutsu and uses the increased hydrogen to set off a large explosion with her paper bomb. Buntan is defeated, but Sarada collapses in exhaustion from excessive usage of her Sharingan. Meanwhile, Kagura fights Boruto and prepares to strike him down; Chojuro takes down three members of Shizuma's gang and is nearly ambushed before Iwabe arrives to take down the fourth, but the two get caught up in a large explosion. Elsewhere, Suigetsu gives Mitsuki a scroll, which he believes will help save Boruto. \n\n\n31\n\"Boruto and Kagura\"\n\"Boruto to Kagura\" (ボルトとかぐら) \nNovember 1, 2017\n\n\nBoruto tries to appeal to Kagura's common sense, but Shizuma's influence keeps Kagura on the attack. However, Mitsuki intervenes and reveals the scroll he received from Suigetsu: A signed confession from Shizuma's benefactors that they were using assassinations to start a new war. With his plan exposed, Shizuma attacks everyone with the Samaheda. Boruto, Kagura and Mitsuki manage to beat Shizuma, but not before the Samaheda fuses with Shizuma to turn him into a monster. Boruto and company overcome the transformed Shizuma and reunite with Sarada and Iwabe before returning to the hotel. \n\n\n32\n\"The Quest for Souvenirs\"\n\"Omiyage kuesuto\" (おみやげク工スト) \nNovember 8, 2017\n\n\nAfter forgetting to get Himawari a souvenir - breaking a promise he made to her, Boruto must find a way to regain her faith in him. He promises her to retrieve his Kirigakure's Water Cinnamon Sweets he \"misplaced\". He proceeds to a shop recommended by Sarada and plays Shinobi Bout with the shop owner; an old lady. Boruto can see her cards via the reflection on a shiny jar behind the old lady and decides to tell her about it, forfeiting from the game. The old lady ultimately gives Boruto the Sweets and he presents it to Himawari. \n\n\n33\n\"The Super Beast Scroll Slump!\"\n\"Suranpu!! Chōjū giga\" (スランプ!!　超獣偽画) \nNovember 15, 2017\n\n\nFrom Inojin Yamanaka’s love of drawing since a young age, his signature technique, Super Beast Imitating Drawing, breathes life into pictures. However, one day he suddenly became unable to use that technique. The confused Inojin sought out his father, Sai, who uses the same technique, but Sai would not give him any advice. For some reason, Sai then recommends Inojin participate in a drawing competition aimed at children. Even though Inojin did well in the competition, Himawari(Daughter of Naruto) was announced as winner by Sai. Inojin decided to master his mom's mind transfer justu and eventually succeed; But, failed later. Inojin realized that he was not able to use the technique(Super Beast Imitating Drawing), cause he lost some thing important to begin with. He accept Himawari as Master and try to learn what he lack in drawing. Finally Inojin realized that he lost his love towards drawing which caused him to lose his signature technique and overcome it with help of Boruto and Himawari. \n\n\n34\n\"The Night of The Shooting Stars\"\n\"Hoshi Furu Yoru\" (星降る夜) \nNovember 22, 2017\n\n\nWhen Boruto realizes that graduating from the academy could mark the end of his friendships, he organizes a camping trip to solidify their bonds. Meanwhile, Sakura teaches a skeptical Sarada about how long friendships can last. \n\n\n35\n\"The Parent Teacher Conference!\"\n\"Sansha Mendan…!!\" (三者面談…!!) \nNovember 29, 2017\n\n\nPrior to the graduation exams, it is decided that the students will take part in a three-person interview to discuss their future plans. Boruto, who has passed his ninjutsu courses with flying colors, realizes his path toward becoming a \"ninja\" has been trouble-free and easy. As the students prepare for their finals, Boruto meets a journalist named Sukea who is doing a story on them. Something about Boruto's indifferent attitude about his future as a ninja raises a red flag in Sukea, and he gives Boruto a warning. \n\n\n36\n\"The Graduation Exam Begins!\"\n\"Sotsugyō shiken kaishi...!!!\" (卒業試験、開始!!!) \nDecember 6, 2017\n\n\nAfter Boruto gets a perfect score in the ninjas' written exam, Kakashi takes interest in testing him. For the next test, the apprentices are tested by Shino, Anko, and Kakashi. Shikadai, Inojin and Chocho face Anko, Sarada and Sumire face Konohamaru, Mitsuki faces Shino, and Boruto faces Kakashi. Although Kakashi remarks that Boruto has the potential to become a mid-level ninja (chunin), he states he lacks something to graduate. After defeating Shino, Mitsuki goes to aid Boruto. \n\n\n37\n\"A Shinobi's Resolve\"\n\"Shinobi no kakugo\" (忍の覚悟) \nDecember 13, 2017\n\n\nMitsuki and his friends save Boruto from Kakashi and retreat following their defeats. At night, the group think of a strategy to defeat their superiors while Boruto thinks about his will to become a ninja. In the morning, all the students manage to trap Kakashi within a barrier while Boruto tries to take the bell from him. Although they fail, Kakashi states they have already passed the test before, much to the children's surprise. As a result, Boruto and all of his friends become ninjas. \n\n\n38\n\"Formation of the Three-Man Squad?\"\n\"Surī manseru, kessei...?\" (スリーマンセル、結成…?) \nDecember 20, 2017\n\n\nThe three-man squads are announced, with Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki assigned to Team 3 under Konohamaru. Sarada immediately requests a transfer to a different squad, which Boruto also wants. Konohamaru tells them that the only way to change teams is to make a direct appeal to the Hokage. Elsewhere, Naruto is training the Hidden Leaf jonin to resist his powers but is dismayed by their apparent weakness. While rushing to find the Hokage, Sarada inadvertently reveals her Sharingan to Boruto. After meeting up with Mitsuki who has Naruto's location pinned down, they are confronted at a bridge by Mirai, a chunin and the granddaughter of the Third Hokage, who has been assigned to guard the bridge. Boruto and Sarada fall into a trap that causes the bridge ropes to snap, but Mitsuki uses his abilities to hold the bridge up - taking him out of the fight in the process. The other two struggle to overcome Mirai's advanced skills and incessant taunting at first but are told by Konohamaru to acknowledge each other's strengths and use teamwork. The pair manage to knock Mirai off the bridge and proceed on to meet with Naruto. Upon meeting him, rather than requesting a transfer, the three request that their squad be renamed \"Team 7\" in honor of the squad their parents were a part of - and hope to one day surpass. Back at the bridge, Mirai has been left tied up with no one to help her. \n\n\n39\n\"The Path Lit By The Full Moon\"\n\"Michita Tsuki ga Terasu Michi\" (満ちた月が照らす道) \nDecember 27, 2017\n\n\nAs Sarada and Mitsuki await Boruto, the former asks the latter what does his aspire to do. Mitsuki then remembers that time ago was in the care of Suigetsu as he suffered from amnesia but still had ninja skills. Mitsuki then meets Orochimaru who introduces himself as his parent and goes on a mission with him to recover his memories. Their enemy is instead revealed to be another \"Mitsuki\" who reveals that rather than children from Orochimaru, they are experiments. Wishing to form his own identity, Mitsuki abandons Orochimaru and goes to Konohagakure, interested in Boruto. Back in the present, Mitsuki tells both Boruto and Sarada that he will always trust them. \n\n\n40\n\"Team 7: The First Mission\"\n\"Dainanahan, Hatsu ninmu!!\" (第七班・初任務!!) \nJanuary 10, 2018\n\n\nTeam 7 is sent on their first mission. Their first mission is to expel bandits from a small village called Green Banks. As Konohamaru entrusts the village's leader, Kiri, that his students are well trained for the mission, the villagers start attacking them in the night. As Sarada realizes they are trapped in an illusion, Boruto finds one of the enemies but is wounded in the clash. After Mitsuki knocks down the berserker villagers, Kiri is taken down by the enemy. \n\n\n41\n\"Strength In Unity\"\n\"Kessoku no chikara\" (結束の力) \nJanuary 17, 2018\n\n\nTeam 7 continue their work by going to save Kiri. The kidnapper who was after his deeds is killed by Rogue Ninjas. Konohamaru takes this chance to face them while his three students rescue Kiri and send her back to her village. However, although Konohamaru is able to defeat his enemy, another Rogue Ninja chases after the young children. As Kiri has been wounded in the previous clash, Boruto, Sarada and Mitsuki decide to work together to let Kiri rest while facing the enemy who is pursuing them. With Boruto and Mitsuki's help, Sarada manages to defeat the Rogue Ninja. After taking Kiri back to her village, Team 7 returns to Konohamaru with all its members satisfied with the results. \n\n\n42\n\"A Ninja's Job\"\n\"Ninja no oshigoto\" (忍者のお仕事) \nJanuary 24, 2018\n\n\n43\n\"The Byakuya Gang Surface\"\n\"Byakuya-dan, arawaru!!\" (白夜団、現る!!) \nJanuary 31, 2018\n\n\n\nQuestion: when does episode 29 of boruto come out\nAnswer:", "answer": "October 18, 2017", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: Since 1718, transportation to the American colonies had been a penalty for various offences in Britain, with approximately one thousand convicts transported per year across the Atlantic.[79] Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to the newly discovered lands of Australia.[80] The western coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch explorer Willem Janszoon in 1606 and was later named New Holland by the Dutch East India Company,[81] but there was no attempt to colonise it. In 1770 James Cook discovered the eastern coast of Australia while on a scientific voyage to the South Pacific Ocean, claimed the continent for Britain, and named it New South Wales.[82] In 1778, Joseph Banks, Cook's botanist on the voyage, presented evidence to the government on the suitability of Botany Bay for the establishment of a penal settlement, and in 1787 the first shipment of convicts set sail, arriving in 1788.[83] Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840.[84] The Australian colonies became profitable exporters of wool and gold,[85] mainly because of gold rushes in the colony of Victoria, making its capital Melbourne for a time the richest city in the world[86] and the second largest city (after London) in the British Empire.[87]\n\nQuestion: where did the british empire control an entire continent\nAnswer:", "answer": "Australia", "aliases": []}

Meanwhile, Goku heads to a local farmer's market to sell his produce and get Chi-Chi off his back about making money. On the way home, he is ambushed by some robbers. Goku defeats them, but he is injured in the process. Deciding that he has grown rusty, Goku and Goten decide to train with Whis. They head to the Capsule Corporation building, where Bulma reveals she is pregnant with her and Vegeta's second child. Goten remains behind to train with Trunks. Vegeta declines to accompany Goku so that he can be with Bulma when she gives birth. Goku heads to Beerus' planet alone. While training with Whis, Goku remembers Zenō-sama's intention to hold a multiverse martial arts tournament. Heedless of Beerus and Whis' warnings, Goku uses Zenō-sama's button to head to his realm and convince both Zenō-samas to hold the tournament. When he returns to Beerus' planet, Beerus angrily berates Goku and explains that Zenō-sama's naive and innocent nature combined with his extreme power makes him a danger to the multiverse. Beerus threatens to kill Goku if he steps out of line again. Goku, Beerus, and Whis head to the Sacred World of the Kais, where the Great Priest arrives. He tells the group to assemble their ten most powerful warriors to compete in the \"Tournament of Power\" (力の大会, Chikara no Taikai). \n\n\n78\n2\n\"The Gods of Every Universe in Shock?! Losers Erased in the Tournament of Power\"\n\"Zen uchū no kami-sama mo don hiki!?

It is a place of \"infinite nothingness\", where the competitors can fight without limits. The tournament champion will be granted a wish by the Super Dragon Balls, while the losers and their respective universes will be completely erased from existence. Everyone is horrified by this harsh penalty. Goku suggests asking Zenō-sama to ignore it, but Whis advises against this. Whis tells Goku that Zenō-sama has already made up his mind and attempting to change it could be dangerous. Beerus demands that Goku takes responsibility for asking Zenō-sama to hold the tournament in the first place. Goku declares that he will defeat any opponent he faces. The Great Priest also reveals that Universes 7 and 9 are to have a smaller exhibition tournament for Future Zenō-sama's benefit. Each universe is to name three fighters. Goku sets off to recruit teammates. After Vegeta refuses, Goku recruits Gohan and Majin Buu, who is accompanied by Mr. Satan to represent Universe 7. Goku also explains the potential penalty to Gohan. Gohan tells Goku to keep the stakes a secret to prevent mass panic. Back at Zenō-sama's palace, all the gods from all 12 universes gather. The Great Priest explains the purpose of the Zen Exhibition Match. He alludes to the possibility of Zenō-sama erasing the fighters that he deems unfit for the tournament. In the first round, Majin Buu is to fight Basil (バジル, Bajiru), a humanoid canine fighter from Universe 9. \n\n\n79\n3\n\"Universe 9's Basil the Kicker VS Universe 7's Majin Buu!!\"\n\"Dai kyu uchū keri no Bajiru basasu Dai nana uchū Majinbū!!\" (第9宇宙蹴りのバジルVS第7宇宙魔人ブウ!!) \nFebruary 19, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nBasil quickly gains the upper hand and beats down Majin Buu, who is not taking the fight seriously and thinks of it as a game. Goku goads Basil into showing his full power to get Majin Buu's attention, which leads to Basil using his ultimate attack. As Roh (ロウ, Rō), the Supreme Kai of Universe 9, claims victory, Majin Buu emerges with a hole in his stomach, but he is otherwise unmoved. Basil and Roh are shocked to see this. Mr. Satan is injured during the attack. He tells Majin Buu to beat Basil before falling unconscious. This enrages Majin Buu to the point, where he effortlessly beats Basil and knocks him out of the ring. However, since neither Zenō-sama is satisfied with the fight, Basil is allowed to get back into the ring. Roh gives Basil a drug that makes him far more powerful. Although Beerus demands that Basil is disqualified for obvious cheating, Zenō-sama is entertained by this and allows the fight to continue. The Great Priest announces that the rules will be improvised as the tournament goes along. Basil overpowers Majin Buu and seemingly beats him, which causes Roh to prematurely gloat about the superiority of Universe 9. However, Majin Buu emerges unscathed and launches a full power attack at Basil. This knocks him out and clinches Universe 7 the victory. As the Universe 9 team laments Basil's loss, Basil's second oldest brother Lavender (ラベンダ, Rabenda) says that if he is allowed to kill his opponent, which Bergamo gives him permission to do, he can win his match. Gohan volunteers to fight Lavender. \n\n\n80\n4\n\"Awaken Your Sleeping Battle Spirit! Son Gohan's Fight!!\"\n\"Nemutta tōshi o yobisamase! Son Gohan no tatakai!!\" (眠った闘志を呼び覚ませ! 孫悟飯の闘い!!) \nFebruary 26, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nAs their battle begins, Lavender spits a poison mist into Gohan's eyes and blinds him. Shin offers Gohan a Senzu bean to cure the poison, but Gohan refuses and says he wants to fight with his strength alone. Unable to see, Gohan uses his other senses to track Lavender and scores several blows. Lavender counters by levitating, which eliminates the sound of his footsteps. Gohan responds by powering up to Super Saiyan and bouncing his own ki off of Lavender's body, which uses it as a kind of active radar. Powering up also causes the poison to spread rapidly through Gohan's body. Lavender mounts a comeback. In desperation, Gohan grabs hold of Lavender and launches a kamikaze attack. He drives both of their bodies into the ring at high speed. Lavender is knocked out, but Gohan is so weakened by the poison that he cannot continue. With both fighters down, the match is declared a tie. After Goku feeds Gohan a Senzu bean, the Great Priest announces to those in attendance that all universes that lose the Tournament of Power will be erased with their respective gods as well. However, Universes 1, 5, 8, and 12 will be exempt from erasure as will the Angels from all universes because their inhabitants are particularly strong. Zeno-sama had long believed that there were too many universes. He was planning to erase most of them anyway, but the tournament will afford one of the weaker universes the chance to be spared. With the announcement concluded, the ring is repaired in preparation for the final exhibition match where Goku will fight Bergamo (ベルガモ, Berugamo), Basil's oldest brother who is also a humanoid canine. \n\n\n81\n5\n\"Bergamo the Crusher Vs Son Goku!

Bergamo pleads with Zenō-sama to rescind the rule that the universes that lose the Tournament of Power be erased. Zenō-sama agrees on the condition that Bergamo beats Goku in an all out battle. Great Priest states that if Goku holds back to cancel the erasure, Zenō-sama will immediately erase all of the universes. Both Goku and Bergamo agree to the terms. When the fight begins, Bergamo invites Goku to hit him and leaves himself exposed. Goku obliges and strikes Bergamo several times, but Bergamo absorbs the energy of Goku's attacks. He grows stronger and physically larger. Goku continues to attack, which causes Bergamo to grow so large that the ring begins to buckle under his weight. Goku transforms to Super Saiyan Blue, which shocks the gods and quickly overwhelms Bergamo with a Kaioken powered Kamehameha. Bergamo claims every universe participating in the Tournament of Power will seek vengeance on Goku for making them face erasure, but Goku relishes the idea of such a challenge. The Zen Exhibition Match comes to a close and the Tournament of Power will soon begin. The universe with the most fighters remaining or the last fighter standing will be declared the winner. Suddenly, a mysterious fighter from Universe 11 named Toppo (トッポ) appears and challenges Goku to a battle. Goku, who is unsatisfied after his short fight with Bergamo, agrees to fight Toppo. \n\n\n82\n6\n\"Never Forgive Son Goku! Toppo the Warrior of Justice Intrudes!!\"\n\"Son Gokū yurusumaji!

Toppo quickly gains the upper hand and dislocates Goku's shoulder. Goku responds by attacking with a flurry of blows, but Toppo manages to grab Goku in a powerful bear hug. He begins squeezing the life out of Goku, which forces Goku to turn Super Saiyan Blue to escape. Goku gains the upper hand in this form and damages Toppo with a Kamehameha. Just as the two power up even more, the Great Priest puts an end to the fight. As Toppo leaves, he reveals to Goku that Universe 11 has a warrior even stronger than him named Jiren (ジレン). The Great Priest begins creating a martial arts arena suitable for the Tournament of Power. In the Sacred World of the Kais, Beerus and Goku get into an argument over Goku's constant relaxed and negligent attitude, which Whis breaks up. The group agrees to convene at the Capsule Corporation to discuss their future strategy. \n\n\n83\n7\n\"Form the Universe 7 Representing Team!

Goku immediately suggests Monaka, but Beerus tells him that Monaka is sick and cannot participate. Goku and Gohan agree on Vegeta, Piccolo, Krillin, Master Roshi, No. 18, and No. 17, which would bring the total number of fighters up to nine. Trunks and Goten are ruled out due to their inexperience. They proceed to ask Vegeta, who has been thinking of a name for his second child. Vegeta refuses to participate. He says he will not fight, while Bulma is pregnant. Whis uses his time warping ability to birth the baby sooner than expected in order to get Vegeta to agree to the fight. Everyone celebrates the baby's birth. Trunks is slightly disappointed he has a sister because he wanted to train with a younger brother. As soon as the baby is handed to Vegeta, he develops an attachment to her. Bulma names the baby Bulla even though Vegeta hoped to give her the Saiyan name Eschalot. However, Vegeta quickly accepts Bulla's name. Goku leaves to recruit members and heads to Krillin's house. \n\n\n84\n8\n\"Son Goku the Recruiter Invites Krillin and No. 18\"\n\"Sukautoman Son Gokū - Kuririn to 18-gō o izanau\" (スカウトマン孫悟空 クリリンと18号を誘う) \nApril 2, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nGoku and Gohan arrive at Krillin's house and ask him and No. 18 to join the Tournament of Power. No. 18 convinces Krillin to participate in order to put his newfound martial arts training to use. No. 18 is reluctant to join herself. She quickly suspects Goku and Gohan of hiding something from them, but Goku convinces her that the secret is a 10 million Zeni reward, which convinces her to participate. Gohan decides to test Krillin in a sparring match on the coast. After Gohan overpowers him in hand to hand combat, Krillin swiftly defeats Gohan by blinding him with his new move named Solar Flare x 100 and knocking him into the sea. Goku is excited by Krillin's new power. He challenges him to a sparring match as well. They relocate to a building owned by Mr. Satan, where Krillin's strategies make up for the gap in power, forcing Goku to go Super Saiyan. Goku then transforms into his Super Saiyan Blue form, and he and Krillin have a Kamehameha clash. As Goku increases his power and starts to overpower Krillin, No. 18 intervenes and blocks Goku's Kamehameha, just as Krillin collapses from exhaustion. She justifies herself by noting that the Tournament of Power will be a battle royal and that Goku cannot expect to fight one-on-one all the time. Goku concedes the match and realizes he will have to adjust his tactics in order to win the Tournament of Power. No. 18 reveals that No. 17 is currently working at a wildlife reserve, but she does not know where. Goku decides to ask Dende to find No. 17. \n\n\n85\n9\n\"The Universes Begin to Make Their Moves Their Individual Motives\"\n\"Ugokidasu uchū - sorezore no omowaku\" (動き出す宇宙 - それぞれの思惑) \nApril 9, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nGohan leaves to recruit Piccolo, while Goku prepares to head to the Lookout. He encounters Majin Buu and Mr. Satan training. Goku discovers that Buu has lost weight and has gotten much slimmer in appearance. The two spar together. Buu defeats Goku by overwhelming him with ki blasts and knocking him out of the fighting stage. Meanwhile, Khai (カイ), the Supreme Kai of Universe 11, gathers all of the Supreme Kais involved in the tournament except for Universe 7's, who is ostracized due to Goku's involvement with the creation of the tournament. Khai asks his fellow Supreme Kais to request that Zenō-sama cancel the erasure of the universes, but they are all too afraid of his wrath to do so. Champa gathers all the Gods of Destruction involved in the tournament except Beerus after finding out about the Supreme Kai's meeting, and they discuss Goku. Toppo recruits his fellow Pride Troopers Kahseral (カーセラル, Kāseraru) and Dyspo (ディスポ, Disupo). Champa recruits Cabba and demands he find more powerful Saiyans. Goku meets Dende and Mr. Popo at the Lookout and learns No. 17's location. Gohan prepares to train with Piccolo. \n\n\n86\n10\n\"Fist Cross for the First Time!

Dende also reveals that Kid Buu has reincarnated as a young Earthling with massive fighting potential and asks Goku to train him when he is old enough. They reach the island as Goku arrives just in time to witness No. 17 defeat a group of armed poachers. As they introduce themselves to each other, a large army of poachers arrive. Goku and No. 17 team up to subdue them all. Afterwards, No. 17 explains that the poachers are after the last Minotaurus in order to steal its rare and valuable horns. The two decide to have a sparring match. No. 17 evenly matches Super Saiyan Goku, which causes him to turn Super Saiyan Blue. Goku launches a Kamehameha at No. 17, who easily deflects it with an energy shield. The two go toe-to-toe until No. 17 ends the match in order to avoid catching the island in the crossfire. Goku and No. 17 acknowledge that they were both holding back in the fight. Afterwards, Goku attempts to convince him to join the Tournament of Power, but No. 17 is uninterested. He remains indifferent even when Goku reveals that the losing universes will be erased. Meanwhile, alien poachers arrive on Earth and they set their sights on the Minotaurus. \n\n\n87\n11\n\"Hunt the Poachers! Goku and No. 17's United Front!!\"\n\"Mitsuryō-dan o kare!

As he begins to consider Goku's offer, the alien poachers arrive and abduct all of the island's animals. Goku uses his Instant Transmission to teleport himself and No. 17 aboard their ship before it can escape. After defeating some of the poachers, No. 17 sets off to defeat the leader, while Goku remains behind to battle the rest of the poachers. No. 17 confronts and easily defeats the leader. Goku catches up just as the leader pulls out a switch and threatens to self-destruct if he is not released immediately. No. 17 smashes him out of a window, which vents both of them into deep space. Goku manages to use his Instant Transmission to teleport all three of them to King Kai's world. Dende contacts Goku and informs him that the leader's threat was a bluff. Afterwards, Goku and No. 17 return the animals to their rightful homes. Jaco arrives to arrest the alien poachers. No. 17 decides to leave his island in the hands of Goten and Trunks and accepts Goku's offer to fight in the Tournament of Power. He hopes to use the Super Dragon Balls to wish for an expensive boat and travel the world with his family. \n\n\n88\n12\n\"Gohan and Piccolo Teacher and Pupil Clash in Max Training!\"\n\"Gohan to Pikkoro Shitei gekitotsu no Genkai shugyō!\" (悟飯とピッコロ 師弟激突の限界修業！) \nApril 30, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nGohan and Piccolo engage in intense training. Piccolo explains that Goku has already informed him about the potential erasure of the universe and that he is going to participate in the Tournament of Power. He points out that Gohan's over eagerness to protect his loved ones is making him reckless. Gohan transforms into a Super Saiyan, and the two continue to spar. Meanwhile, Cabba heads to the residence of his retired captain and mentor, Renso (レンソウ). Cabba asks him to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power, but Renso refuses due to an injury to his leg. Renso suggests his sister, Caulifla (カリフラ, Karifura), instead, who he claims is even stronger than him. Back in Universe 7, Piccolo removes his weighted clothes to go all out and quickly defeats Gohan. Piccolo explains that Gohan has a tendency to become arrogant when he has the advantage in battle. After being encouraged by Piccolo, Gohan manages to reach the level of power he had against Super Buu. The two fight again, and Gohan successfully severs Piccolo's arm. However, Piccolo blasts him in the back with the severed arm and defeats Gohan, which proves Piccolo's point about Gohan's overconfidence. That night, Piccolo vows to push Gohan to new heights of power. They both agree to work on combination moves. \n\n\n89\n13\n\"An Unknown Beauty Appears!

Goku decides to make Tien the tenth member of the team, and heads off to recruit him and Roshi. At Tien's dojo, a woman named Yurin (ユーリン, Yūrin) with a grudge against Tien arrives and requests to join the dojo. Although Tien denies her because her motivation of beauty was unfit for his dojo, Roshi drags Yurin off to ogle her. Goku arrives and asks Tien to join the Tournament of Power, but, even after Goku bribes him with 10 million Zeni, Tien refuses. Yurin escapes Roshi's advances and uses witchcraft to drive Tien's students on a rampage throughout town. Goku, Tien, Chiaotzu, and Roshi arrive at the village, where Yurin confronts them. Yurin explains that she is a former classmate of Tien's during his time at the Crane School and that she swore revenge on him after he left the school and refused to fight her. Meanwhile, Cabba sways Caulifla into joining Universe 6's team by promising to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. Back on Earth, while Goku, Chiaotzu, and Tien cure the students of their brainwashing, Roshi battles Yurin. He lowers his guard after catching a glimpse of Yurin's panties, which allows her to brainwash him. The brainwashed Roshi quickly defeats Tien, but Goku intervenes. While Chiaotzu temporarily disables Yurin, Goku subdues Roshi with a Kamehameha and cures him of the brainwashing. Tien orders Yurin to apologize to everyone she hurt and offers her a place at his dojo. Tien decides to join the Tournament of Power because he believes that the 10 million Zeni Goku promised will repair the village. After hearing about the 10 million Zeni, Master Roshi quickly agrees to join as well. \n\n\n90\n14\n\"See The Wall That Must Be Passed! Goku vs Gohan\"\n\"Koerubeki kabe o misuete!

At Gohan's request, Goku and Tien have a fight against Gohan and Piccolo to practice for the tournament. Although Tien views this as a practice match and wants to avoid injuring anyone, Gohan and Goku take the fight seriously. As Gohan fights both his father and Tien, Piccolo spends the time charging a strong technique, which ultimately destroys the mountain fighting stage when it is launched. Tien calls the match off on the grounds that the fighting stage is now destroyed. Although Goku agrees, Gohan requests to have a one-on-one fight against his father. Goku accepts, and Gohan powers up while Goku goes Super Saiyan 2. Although Goku has the upper hand for much of the fight, Gohan turns the tables and begins to overpower Goku. Gohan begs Goku to use his full power. Goku responds by becoming a Super Saiyan Blue and using his Kaio-Ken technique, then defeats Gohan with a single blow. Impressed with his son's improvement, Goku assigns Gohan as the leader of their Universe 7 team.

In Universe 9, word has spread of the potential erasure of their universe. The populace has descended into anarchy. The three canine brothers have been unable to find any other fighters. In Universe 6, Hit tracks down the destitute Frost and forces him to join the Tournament of Power, while he relieves him of his poison needles in the process. In Universe 11, Toppo's comrade Kahseral is delayed from joining when he aids a cat stuck in a tree. In Universe 2, a magical girl named Brianne de Chateau (ブリアン・デ・シャトー, Burian de Shatō) transforms into her alter ego named Ribrianne (リブリアン, Riburian) and auditions for a spot in the tournament.

After Goku fails to convince them otherwise, Beerus swiftly threatens Krillin into staying, while Bulma agrees to pay out the promised reward. In Universe 6, Cabba takes Caulifla to a deserted wasteland to teach her how to become a Super Saiyan. As Caulifla's protégée, Kale (ケール, Kēru), observes them, Cabba ineffectually attempts to provoke Caulifla in order to make her transform. When that fails, he teaches her to focus her energy on an area in her back. Caulifla successfully transforms into a Super Saiyan. Caulifla tests her newfound power and agrees to join Universe 6's team for the Tournament of Power. She beckons Kale over to attempt the transformation herself. In Universe 11, Kahseral arrives at the Pride Trooper headquarters, where he and Toppo agree to leave the universe in their trainees' hands so they can participate in the tournament.

In Universe 6, Cabba and Caulifla attempt to teach Kale how to turn into a Super Saiyan but to no avail. Kale begins to despair over her own uselessness, and it enrages her enough to trigger her transformation into an extremely powerful Berserker Super Saiyan. Kale immediately goes berserk and attacks Cabba. Caulifla quickly deduces that Kale is jealous of her and Cabba's perceived relationship. She denies having any sort of feelings for Cabba. Kale calms down and collapses in Caulifla's arms. Cabba, who is impressed by Kale's power, decides to add her to Universe 6's team. Back in Universe 7, Goku arrives in the afterlife and receives King Yemma's permission to visit Frieza. He explains about the Tournament of Power and asks Frieza to join them. Frieza agrees to aid him on the condition that he be properly resurrected with Earth's Dragon Balls.

Frieza spitefully uses the attack on Goku and traps him. Frieza tortures and kills the assassins until they reveal that Roh and Sidra hired them. Frieza contacts Universe 9 and offers his services as a defector. Roh and Sidra begin arguing about whether or not to accept him. Roh fears Frieza's psychopathic and treasonous nature, while Sidra wants his power. Sidra is confident he could kill him if he stepped out of line. Their argument buys time for Beerus and Whis to arrive and rescue Goku. Frieza cuts the connection. He begins making plans to use the Tournament of Power to manipulate the gods to suit his own ends. Goku and Frieza have a brief sparring match, which ends in a draw. Goku, Frieza, Beerus, and Whis return to the Capsule Corporation. The Universe 7 team prepare to travel to the World of Void for the Tournament of Power. \n\n\n96\n20\n\"The Time Is Here! To The World Of Void For The Fate Of The Universe!!\"\n\"Toki wa kita! Uchū no Meiun o kake Mu no Kai e!!\" (時はきた! 宇宙の命運をかけ無の界へ!!) \nJune 25, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nIn the World of Void, Universes 1, 5, and 8's Gods of Destruction Iwne (イワン, Iwan), Arack (アラク, Araku), and Liquiir (リキュール, Rikīru) have a brief exhibition match to test the durability of the Tournament of Power's fighting stage. Afterwards, the Great Priest forces them all to clean up their mess and fix the stage. In Universe 7, Gohan and Shin's strategy is to have the team members stick together to conserve energy and use strength of numbers to defeat anyone who attacks them. This suggestion offends Goku and Vegeta's Saiyan pride. Whis transports the team to the World of Void. All of the other universes arrive. Frieza and Frost befriend each other and agree to work together, while Goku singles out Jiren as a potential rival due to his extreme power. As the Great Priest introduces each team, Universe 4 seemingly has only 8 warriors on their team, which confuses most of Universe 7, except for Tien, who tells No. 18 that he can sense a faint presence. After a speech from the Zenō-samas, the 80 warriors prepare for battle. \n\n\n97\n21\n\"Survive! The Tournament of Power Begins at Last!!\"\n\"Ikinokore! Tsui ni kaimaku Chikara no Taikai!!\" (生き残れ! ついに開幕「力の大会」!!) \nJuly 2, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nThe Great Priest reminds everyone of the rules and officially starts the tournament. A massive free-for-all ensues. Goku targets Toppo, but he is intercepted by Ganos. Disregarding Gohan's plan as well, No. 17, No. 18, Vegeta, and Frieza all jump into the fray. Universe 3 gains an early advantage when Narirama unleashes a spinning attack designed to knock its opponents off the stage, but Hit and Basil disable it. Universe 10's Lilibeu (リリベウ, Ririberu) attacks Basil, but Basil successfully knocks her off the stage. Meanwhile, the five Universe 7 warriors who stayed together are confronted by a gang of warriors from varying universes, but Universe 7 uses teamwork to fend them off. Basil nearly defeats Universe 10's Napapa, but Napapa is able to push his attacks away at the last moment. As Goku is pursuing Toppo, he comes face to face with Jiren until Universe 4's Nink (ニンク, Ninku) outflanks Goku by grappling and dragging him towards the edge of the stage with the intention of jumping off with him. Goku turns Super Saiyan Blue and knocks Nink off the stage. As Goku reverts back to his normal form to conserve energy, Basil, Lavender, Bergamo, and two other Universe 9 warriors surround him with 47 minutes remaining in the tournament. \n\n\n98\n22\n\"Oh, Uncertainty! A Universe Despairs!!\"\n\"Ā mujou! Zetsubō suru Uchū!!\" (あぁ無常! 絶望する宇宙!!) \nJuly 9, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nRoh orders his warriors to attack Goku to avenge their defeat at the Zen Exhibition Match. Goku is forced to avoid fighting at his fullest in order to conserve stamina for later in the tournament. He fights Team Universe 9, where the Trio de Dangers brothers manage to overwhelm him thanks to their teamwork. Vegeta notices Goku's plight and reinforces him. Roh sends over three more fighters. Team Universe 9 is able to push Goku and Vegeta to the brink until Vegeta tricks Lavender and Hop (ソレル, Hoppu) into accidentally hitting each other. Goku and Vegeta take advantage of the confusion to defeat five of the Universe 9 warriors. No. 18 and Frieza each defeat Sorrel (ソレル, Soreru) and Roselle. Only Basil, Lavender, and Bergamo remain in the tournament for Team Universe 9. Goku and Vegeta push them to the edge of the stage. The brothers use a combination beam as a last ditch effort, but Goku and Vegeta power up to Super Saiyan Blue and knock them off the stage with a Final Kamehameha. With all 10 members defeated, Universe 9 is eliminated from the tournament. As a result, the Zenō-samas erase Universe 9, Roh, Sidra, and all of their fighters. This amuses Universe 9's angel Mojito (モヒイト, Mohi'ito) and horrifies everyone else. \n\n\n99\n23\n\"Show Them! Krillin's True Power!!\"\n\"Misetsukero! Kuririn no sokojikara!!\" (見せつけろ! クリリンの底力!!) \nJuly 16, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nAs the other warriors recover from the shock of Universe 9's erasure, No. 17 reminds No. 18 that they have infinite stamina due to their cyborg bodies and have no reason to hold back. Vegeta tries to fight Hit, but he is blocked by Botamo, who is immune to damage. Vegeta manages to pick Botamo up and nearly throws him off the stage, but Magetta stops him at the last moment. Meanwhile, Universe 10's Jium (ジウム, Jiumu) attacks Gohan and his friends. Jium is swiftly defeated by Master Roshi. Universe 4's Shosa (ショイサ, Shōsa) tricks No. 18 into lowering her guard by faking his own death and nearly knocks her off the stage with a barrage of ki blasts. Krillin rescues No. 18, and the two defeat Shosa with a powerful combination attack. They are challenged by Universe 4's Majora (マジョラ), who is a blind fighter that uses his powerful sense of smell to locate his enemies in battle. Although Majora proves to be stronger than Krillin, Krillin disables his nose by throwing his smelly shoe at him and knocks him off the stage. Krillin boasts about his victory, which allows Frost to knock him off with a single blow. Beerus and Shin berate Krillin for his carelessness with 43 minutes remaining in the tournament. \n\n\n100\n24\n\"Out Of Control! The Savage Berserker Awakens!!\"\n\"Daibōsō!

Hit blows off Narirama's limbs and uses his time skip ability to dodge his ultimate attack. He flicks him off the stage. Meanwhile, Kale is disabled by Universe 10's Napapa and Methiop (メチオープ). They knock her unconscious and attempt to throw her off the stage, but Caulifla rescues her and defeats Napapa. The two confront Goku, and Caulifla knocks away Universe 2's Jimeze (ジーミズ, Jimizu) and demands to know how to become a Super Saiyan Blue. Goku refuses, and Caulifla transforms into an Ultra Super Saiyan. However, her increased muscle mass cripples her speed and allows Goku to counterattack. With Goku's aid, Caulifla manages to become a Super Saiyan 2, and the two resume their fight. As Kale watches them, she is once again consumed by her feelings of uselessness and transforms into her Berserker Super Saiyan form. Hit uses his time skip to save Caulifla from getting caught in the crossfire. Kale flies into a jealous rage and attacks Goku for allegedly stealing Caulifla from her. Kale easily overwhelms Goku and forces him to power up to Super Saiyan Blue. He unleashes a powerful Kamehameha, but Kale powers through it unharmed. As Piccolo realizes she has lost control of her power, Kale begins firing ki blasts at everything in sight and defeats Methiop. When Universe 11's Vuon (ブーオン, Būon) attempts to stop her, Kale defeats him as well. Jiren knocks her unconscious with a single ki blast. As Hit and Caulifla retreat with Kale, Goku challenges Jiren. \n\n\n101\n25\n\"The Impending Warriors of Justice! The Pride Troopers!!\"\n\"Semari kuru seigi no senshi! Puraido Torūpāsu!!\" (迫りくる正義の戦士！プライド・トルーパス！！) \nJuly 30, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nAs Goku prepares to fight Jiren, Toppo suddenly ambushes him with a barrage of ki blasts. Toppo and Jiren decide to retreat and conserve their stamina. This leaves Goku to be dealt with by Kahseral and their fellow Pride Troopers Tupper (タッパー, Tappā), Zoiray (ゾイレー, Zoirē), Cocotte (ココット, Kokotto), and Kettol. The five declare their intent to defeat Caulifla and Kale to avenge Vuon's defeat. The two are forced to form a temporary alliance with Goku. Meanwhile, Master Roshi and Tien team up to defeat Universe 3's The Preecho (ザ・プリーチョ). They regroup with Gohan, Piccolo, Vegeta, and Frieza, where he has defeated Murichim. The Pride Troopers push Goku, Caulifla, and Kale to the brink, but No. 17 and No. 18 rescue them. No. 18 and Goku defeat Tupper, while No. 17 easily overpowers Kahseral. The remaining Pride Troopers regroup and focus their assault on the wounded Caulifla and Kale. Cocotte seals them in a separate dimension to ensure that Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 do not interfere. As the four beat Caulifla, Kale's self-hatred causes her to return to the Berserker Super Saiyan form, but she remains in control of herself this time. Caulifla and Kale use an extremely powerful combination ki blast to defeat Kahseral, Zoiray, and Kettol. Cocotte seals herself in a mini-dimension to avoid the blast, but No. 18 simply throws it off, eliminating Cocotte. Goku allows Caulifla and Kale to retreat so he can fight them at their full strength after they rest. The group is unaware that Brianne is observing them. \n\n\n102\n26\n\"The Power of Love Explodes?!

No. 17 blasts them before they can transform, but Brianne, Goku, and Toppo berate him for his dishonorable tactics and browbeat him into allowing them to transform, much to Beerus' dismay. They assume their alter-egos Ribrianne, Kakunsa (カクンサ, Kakunsa), and Rozie (ロージィ, Rōjī) and barrage the arena with a powerful love-based attack that brainwashes some of the fighters. Universe 7's mental discipline allows them to overcome its effects. Gohan's group elects to split up and fight independently. Vegeta attacks Ribrianne, who counters with a rolling attack that knocks out Universe 10's Jirasen (ジラセン). Rozie attacks Goku with a flurry of blows that grows more powerful the longer she keeps it up, while Kakunsa battles No. 17 with her animalistic fighting style. No. 17 baits her into overextending herself and stuns her with a barrier. He attempts to knock her out of the stage, but her teammate Vikal (ビカル, Bikaru) rescues her. No. 17 decides to stop holding back and swiftly eliminates Vikal. He also eliminates Kakunsa with a powerful ki blast. Enraged by his actions, Ribrianne powers up and prepares to battle No. 17. \n\n\n103\n27\n\"Gohan, Show No Mercy! Showdown With Universe 10!!\"\n\"Gohan yo hijōnare!

She surrounds him with ki balls and attempts to blow him up, but No. 17 protects him with a barrier. Goku, who has studied Rozie's techniques, hits her with a powerful ki blast. As he and No. 17 corner Rozie and Ribrianne, Jimeze arrives and rescues them with instant transmission. Elsewhere, Botamo challenges Gohan on Champa's orders. As Piccolo and Goku observe, Gohan attacks with a flurry of blows, which apparently have no effect. However, Gohan's attacks begin to lift Botamo off the ground and renders him unable to defend himself, allowing Gohan to knock him off the stage. Universe 10's Obuni (オブニ) and Rubalt (ルバルト, Rubaruto) appear to challenge Gohan and Piccolo. Jimeze defeats Universe 10's Jilcol (ジルコル Jirukoru). With 8 warriors eliminated, Gowasu accepts his imminent demise, while Rumsshi remains defiant. Obuni shifts his ki away from his body to render himself impossible to detect and wounds Gohan. Rubalt initially has the upper hand against Piccolo, but Piccolo uses his Hellzone Grenade attack to knock out Rubalt, leaving Universe 10 with only Obuni. Obuni begins to overwhelm Gohan, which makes Gowasu want to cling to life again. Gohan powers up and powers through one of Obuni's punches. He counterattacks Obuni's moves by locating and hitting Obuni after he gets hit. Obuni pauses the fight to show his respect for Gohan, but refuses to lose for the sake of Universe 10. Gohan battles and defeats Obuni with a Kamehameha. All of Universe 10's fighters have been eliminated. Right before Universe 10 is annihilated, Gohan discovers a locket containing a picture of Obuni and his wife and child. Gohan and Universe 10's angel, Cus (クス, Kusu), mourn Universe 10's erasure. \n\n\n104\n28\n\"The Ultimate High Speed Battle Begins! Goku and Hit Join Forces!!\"\n\"Chōzetsu kōsoku batoru boppatsu!

Everyone quickly deduces that Dyspo is listening for the sound of Hit's body tensing up to determine when he is about to attempt to use Time Skip. Hit resorts to fighting him conventionally, but he is pushed to the edge of the stage. Toppo deduces that Hit has adjusted to Dyspo's fighting style and is luring him into a trap. Toppo sends fellow pride trooper Kunshi (クンシー, Kunshī) to back him up. Before Dyspo can land the finishing blow, Hit suddenly turns intangible and sends Dyspo over the edge. However, Kunshi uses ropes made of his energy to pull Dyspo back onto the stage before he is eliminated. The two launch a renewed assault against Hit and drive him into a corner. Before they can finish him off, Goku interferes and rescues Hit. Goku uses his Super Saiyan God form to counter Dyspo's speed, while Hit uses his assassination technique to injure Kunshi. The two switch places. Hit uses a fake Time Skip to throw Dyspo off and wound him, while Goku overwhelms Kunshi with his Super Saiyan Blue form. Hit attempts to eliminate Dyspo, but Kunshi rescues him again. Kunshi charges Hit, who turns intangible and knocks him off the stage. Dyspo retreats and regroups with his allies. Toppo abandons all notions of justice and decides to focus on survival. Hit decides not to battle Goku as thanks for lending a hand. Goku and Hit vow to settle the score if they both make it to the end of the tournament. \n\n\n105\n29\n\"A Desperate Battle! Master Roshi's Sacrifice!!\"\n\"Funsen! Mutenroshi inochi o Moyasu!!\" (奮戦！ 武天老師命を燃やす！！) \nAugust 27, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nMaster Roshi quietly observes the battles from afar. He is challenged by an attractive warrior from Universe 4, Caway (キャウェイ, Kyauei), who attempts to seduce him. However, Caway's attempts to attack him brings him back to his senses. Roshi destroys her energy weapon, powers up, and drives her to jump off the stage. Roshi is next challenged by Dercori (ダーコリ, Dākori), who is a talisman-wielding warrior from Universe 4. She uses her talismans to confound Roshi with illusions and trap him in a single spot. Roshi uses the Evil Containment Wave to seal her in a small bottle and throw her off the arena. Quitela and Beerus get into an argument about the legality of the move, which is defused when both Zenō-samas rule in Roshi's favor. Ganos, who is enraged at Roshi for eliminating his friends, challenges him and powers up into an avian form. Initially, Roshi is able to use his experience to predict, evade, and counter Ganos' attacks. However, Ganos is able to grow more powerful the longer a fight drags on. He rallies and delivers a fierce series of blows to Roshi. Roshi attempts to hypnotize Ganos into falling asleep, but he attacks himself to wake himself up. Ganos demands that Roshi accept his limits and give up, but Roshi refuses. He unleashes a Max Power Kamehameha that defeats Ganos. However, the effort is too much for Roshi's body to handle, and he collapses. Goku races over to him and successfully defibrillates him with his ki. Goku escorts Roshi to safety. \n\n\n106\n30\n\"Find Him! Death Match With An Invisible Attacker!!\"\n\"Mikiwamero! Sugata naki atakkā to no shitō!!\" (見極めろ！ 姿なきアタッカーとの死闘!!) \nSeptember 3, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nGoku brings Master Roshi to an isolated part of the stage and leaves him to rest at his request. Gohan and Piccolo are confronted by Universe 6's Dr. Rota (Dr.ロタ, Dokutā Rota), but Rota is shot down by a sniper before he can reveal his ability. Gohan and Piccolo are unable to find the location of the sniper until they find a red orb on the ground. It is revealed that the sniper, Universe 2's Prum (プラン, Puran), can see through these orbs. The lasers ricochet off of the orbs so that his true location is a secret. Piccolo tries to create a smokescreen in order to blur the vision, but Prum can still see them via their heat signatures. Prum shoots Piccolo and destroys both of his arms, which forces him to painfully regenerate them. Gohan and Piccolo realize that the orbs depend on heat signatures and blast the surrounding area to create multiple heat signatures. Prum responds by coming out of his hiding spot and blasting the entire area. Gohan and Piccolo are forced into hiding. Tien analyzes Dr. Rota and deduces that he was hit by a sniper as Goku and Vegeta arrive. Vegeta berates Tien, who warns them about Prum, but Vegeta arrogantly brushes it off until he is almost incapacitated by one of Prum's blasts. As Goku and Tien observe Prum, they deduce that there is another shooter from behind as Prum is merely reflecting the blasts. Vegeta and Goku go after Prum, while Tien goes to save Gohan and Piccolo. Goku and Vegeta try to attack Prum, but their ki blasts are reflected off of his body. Tien navigates through the field of blasts and confronts the true sniper, Prum's teammate Hermila (ハーミラ, Hāmira). Realizing that Prum can deflect ki blasts and not physical attacks, Vegeta and Goku throw giant boulders at him. Tien uses his Multi-form technique in order to buy himself time against Hermila, but three of his clones are shot down. The fourth and final Tien defeats Hermila. Just as Tien is about to eliminate him, Hermila shoots the ground underneath Tien's feet and knocks him off the stage. However, Tien's other three clones come back and drag Hermila down with them. Tien and Hermila are eliminated from the tournament. Although Beerus praises Tien for forcing the battle into a draw, Tien is noticeably upset about being defeated. As Prum is confronted by Vegeta, Dr. Rota comes back and attacks Prum as revenge for shooting him. Shortly after, Vegeta eliminates Prum and Dr. Rota from the tournament. \n\n\n107\n31\n\"Revenge \"F\" The Cunning Trap?!\"\n\"Fukushū no Efu!

Elsewhere, Universe 3's Maji Kayo confronts Universe 11's remaining warriors. He entraps Dyspo with his liquid body, but Jiren effortlessly defeats him with a single blow. As Master Roshi attempts to recover from his previous fights, Frost corners and attacks him. Goku sees this and tries to rush to his aid, but he is confronted by Ribrianne. Roshi hits Frost with a flurry of blows and attempts to use the Evil Containment Wave, but the strain proves too much for him. He flubs the attack. Frost barrages Roshi with ki blasts and sends an attack towards Vegeta, which provokes him. Vegeta interferes before Frost can finish Roshi. Magetta arrives to reinforce Frost, and the two battle Vegeta. Frost goads Roshi into using the Evil Containment Wave on Magetta despite the risk of killing himself. When Roshi falls for it, Frost reflects the attack and seals Vegeta into a bottle. With the last of his strength, Roshi uses a small ki blast to destroy the bottle and free Vegeta. Vegeta immediately turns Super Saiyan Blue, and Frost flees. Vegeta knocks Magetta off the stage and tells Roshi to drop out so he can receive medical attention. Roshi jumps off the stage, and he is given a Senzu Bean. Beerus admits that Roshi has earned his respect. \n\n\n108\n32\n\"Frieza and Frost! Conjoined Malice?!\"\n\"Furīza to Furosuto!

Meanwhile, Gohan is confronted by Jimeze. Jimeze makes use of his Instant Transmission technique to confound and damage Gohan. As he prepares to finish him, Frieza intervenes. When Frieza does not immediately attack Jimeze, Universe 7's spectators speculate he may intend to betray and defeat Gohan so he can seize the wish on the Super Dragon Balls for himself. Frieza steps aside and allows Jimeze to continue his fight with Gohan. Jimeze corners Gohan again and attempts to finish him, but Frieza destroys his attack with a ki blast. Enraged, Jimeze attacks Frieza, who swiftly tortures and eliminates him. Frost appears and declares his intention to defeat Gohan, and Frieza admits that the two intend to work together in order to exact revenge on the Saiyans. Frieza battles Gohan, who counterattacks. Frieza uses his Golden form to knock out Gohan. However, instead of eliminating him, he double-crosses and eliminates Frost. Gohan admits that he immediately figured out Frieza's plan and played along with him. An enraged Frost attempts to attack Frieza from the spectator stands, but Zenō-sama erases him, who explains this is forbidden and Universe 6 would be erased upon a second offence. Meanwhile, Goku continues to battle Ribrianne. \n\n\n109\n33\n\"The Ultimate Enemy Approaches Goku! Now, Let Loose! The Killer Spirit Bomb!!\"\n\"Goku ni Semaru Saikyo no Teki! Ima Koso Hanate!

Goku considers using the wish to benefit his family or meet a strong opponent. Ribrianne absorbs the love of her teammates and becomes Super Ribrianne. She attacks Goku with several ki blasts, and he counters by turning Super Saiyan Blue and knocking her away. Ribrianne lands near Jiren, and Goku sees him and prepares to finally battle him. Universe 11's God of Destruction, Belmod, telepathically orders Jiren to defeat Goku. Belmod hopes to demoralize the other universes by defeating the strongest fighter besides Jiren himself. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20, but that proves to be no match for Jiren's overwhelming power. Goku begins powering up a Spirit Bomb, and all of his teammates except Vegeta lend him their energy. Despite the time it takes to charge the attack, Jiren agrees to wait for him to complete it. Ribrianne attempts to attack Goku from behind, but she is stopped by Vegeta. Goku completes the Spirit Bomb and throws it, but Jiren deflects it. The two engage in a struggle to take control of the Spirit Bomb. This forces Goku to use Super Saiyan Blue Kaioken x20 to keep up. However, Jiren prevails and begins to overwhelm Goku with his own attack. \n\n\n110\n34\n\"Son Goku Wakes! New Level of the Awakened!!\"\n\"Son Gokū kakusei!

Whis realizes that Jiren is at least as powerful as a God of Destruction. As the two struggle to overpower each other, the Spirit Bomb suddenly condenses into a small black ball, which absorbs Goku and causes him to vanish. The Great Priest rules that since Goku's own attack apparently vaporized him, Jiren will not be disqualified for destroying him. As the Zenō-samas prepare to eliminate Goku, he suddenly reappears and reaches a new level of power. Goku resumes the fight, and he is able to go toe-to-toe with Jiren. Whis theorizes Goku must have absorbed the Spirit Bomb and unlocked an ability called Ultra Instinct (身勝手の極意, Migatte no Goku'i'). Goku uses another powerful attack in an attempt to eliminate Jiren, but he fails and exhausts his newfound power. Jiren knocks him away, and Hit attempts to take advantage of the opportunity and attacks Jiren. Vegeta demands to know what happened to Goku before preparing to fight Ribrianne, while Frieza appears to corner Goku and aim an attack at him. \n\n\n111\n35\n\"The Surreal Supreme Battle!

Meanwhile, Hit uses his time-skip powers against Jiren, but his attacks fail to connect. Goku spectates the battle, but he is ambushed by Saonel (サオネル, Saoneru) and Pirina (ピリナ, Pirina), Namekians from Universe 6, who are confronted by Gohan and Piccolo. Elsewhere, Vegeta fights Ribrianne, and he is easily overpowering her in his base form until Rozie interferes and retreats with Ribrianne. Ribrianne loses hope due to the gap in power, but Rozie motivates her. Meanwhile, Hit keeps attacking Jiren to no avail, but he is able to react and block most of Jiren's punches. After being knocked back, Hit sneaks up behind Jiren and lands a strong punch on his heart. He knocks Jiren to the edge of the ring after a brief struggle. Hit uses his own time-skip powers continually on Jiren to stop his movement. Realizing that he cannot hold Jiren for long, Hit urges Cabba, Caulifla, and Kale to keep fighting for Universe 6. Hit pools all his energy in a final attack to defeat him, but Jiren stops Hit's attack only with his glare. Jiren breaks free and eliminates Hit. As the Tournament of Power reaches its midway point, Jiren begins to meditate. He is certain that there are no other warriors strong enough to fight him. Jiren leaves the fight to Toppo and Dyspo. Viara (ビアラ, Biara) and Katopesla (カトペスラ, Katopesura) of Universe 3 attempt to attack him while meditating, but Jiren's energy alone is enough to push them back. \n\n\n112\n36\n\"A Saiyan's Vow!

However, he is suddenly targeted by Koitsukai (コイツカイ, Koitukai), Panchia (パンチア, Panchia), and Bollarator (ボラレータ, Borarēta) of Universe 3. Gohan and Piccolo want to help him, but they are distracted by their own battle with Saonel and Pilina. Caulifla and Kale are discussing the battle between Goku and Jiren, when they are confronted by Monna (モンナ, Monna), a female warrior from Universe 4. Caulifla faces off against Monna, but Cabba appears and takes her place. He instructs Caulifla and Kale to retreat for now. Cabba turns Super Saiyan and battles Monna, but he is initially overpowered. Monna almost knocks Cabba off the stage, but Vegeta intervenes and catches him before he can fall. Vegeta and Cabba both promise that, if either of them wins the tournament, the winner will use the Super Dragon Balls to restore the other's erased universe and its inhabitants. Newly inspired, Cabba fights Monna again, but he is losing until he taps into his anger and unlocks Super Saiyan 2. With his new power, Cabba easily defeats and eliminates Monna. However, Frieza appears, fights Cabba, and easily eliminates him as well. Frieza reveals that he plans to win the tournament in order to use the Super Dragon Balls to control the gods. Meanwhile, Vegeta decides to challenge Jiren, but he is intercepted by Toppo. The two battle each other. Vegeta ends up meeting up with Goku, who is still having difficulty with his three opponents. However, Caulifla intervenes and knocks Koitsukai, Borareta, and Pancea away before powering up to Super Saiyan 2 and challenging Goku herself. \n\n\n113\n37\n\"With Great Joy!

She begins fighting Goku, who does not initially power up beyond his base form. However, Goku's superior martial arts skills allow him to keep up with her even in her Super Saiyan 2 form. Eventually, she is able to adapt to his moves, which forces Goku to power up to Super Saiyan 2 himself. The two of them fight evenly for some time. Goku later calls in Kale to join the battle. His superior power and skill enables him to fight them both at once, but they are able to match him by working together. They land a massive combined attack on him, but Goku powers up to Super Saiyan 3 and easily deflects their attacks. However, Goku lacks the stamina to maintain that form and reverts to Super Saiyan 2. Kale's desire to become stronger inadvertently causes her to transform into her Berserker Super Saiyan form again. \n\n\n114\n38\n\"Intimidating Passion!

Caulifla and Kale battle Goku together and are able to hold him off. Meanwhile, Frieza is confronted by Katopesla, but they are interrupted by Goku's battle with Caulifla and Kale. Frieza wants to fight Caulifla and Kale, but Goku insists that he will fight them himself. Frieza backs down and watches the fight. The three Saiyans resume their battle. After unsuccessfully attempting to use Instant Transmission as a strategy, Goku powers up to his Super Saiyan God form and easily overpowers the two of them. As Goku prepares to eliminate Caulifla and Kale with a powerful Kamehameha, it is revealed that the girls were given a pair of Potara earrings by Fuwa, Universe 6's Supreme Kai. They use the earrings and fuse to become a single being with immense power, who takes the name Kefla (ケフラ, Kefura). \n\n\n115\n39\n\"Goku VS Kefla!

No. 18 is attacked by Katopesla, but she is saved by No. 17. Meanwhile, Goku continues his fight with Kefla. The Zenōs approve Kefla's use of the Potara earrings. The other universes consider giving the Potara to their warriors as well. Pell (ペル, Peru), the Supreme Kai of Universe 2, gives his Potara to Rabanra (ラバンラ, Rabanra) and Zarbuto (ザーブト, Zābuto), but the earrings are destroyed by Kefla charging through them to continue fighting Goku. The battle becomes intense with Kefla gaining the upper hand. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue, but Kefla counters by powering up to Super Saiyan. However, Goku uses the Kaio-ken and regains the advantage. He appears to be winning, but Kefla lands a sneak attack that knocks him out of Super Saiyan Blue. She prepares to eliminate him, but Goku unexpectedly reawakens Ultra Instinct again and easily dodges her attacks. \n\n\n116\n40\n\"The Sign of a Comeback!

Goku still easily dodges Kefla's attacks, but his own attacks are not enough to take her down. When Goku launches his attacks, it interferes with his concentration and prevents him from using Ultra Instinct to its full potential. Jiren senses the energy from their battle, which prompts him to awaken from his meditation and rejoin Toppo and Dyspo. Vegeta realizes that Ultra Instinct is the level of skill that Whis was training him and Goku to attain. Vegeta decides that he must reach it too. Goku begins running low on stamina. He declares that he will end the fight with his next attack. Kefla panics and unleashes a multitude of deadly energy beams. Her ultimate attack devastates the ring, but Goku easily dodges her blasts while charging a Kamehameha. Goku jumps into the air. Kefla focuses all of her power into a single blast and launches it at him. She takes advantage of his apparent inability to dodge. However, he back flips and uses the charge up energy to slide over her attack and launches his Kamehameha at point-blank range. Goku blasts Kefla out of the ring and eliminates her. Her Potara earrings shatter, and she splits back into Kale and Caulifla. With both of them eliminated, Saonel and Pirina are the only remaining warriors from Team Universe 6.\n\nNOTE: This episode is dedicated in memory of Hiromi Tsuru, who passed away on November 16, 2017. \n\n\n117\n41\n\"Showdown of Love!

He is confronted by all five remaining warriors from Universe 2. Gohan and Piccolo try to help him, but they are intercepted by Saonel and Pirina. Elsewhere, Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and tries to unlock Ultra Instinct against him. However, he is unsuccessful and resorts to his normal fighting style. Vegeta easily overpowers Katopesla. Rozie and Ribrianne launch a combined attack at Goku, but No. 17 and No. 18 arrive in time to deflect it. The androids battle Rozie and Ribrianne. No. 17 defeats and eliminates Rozie, while No. 18 knocks Ribrianne out of her powered-up transformation. This causes her to revert into Brianne. Brianne is able to catch No. 18 in an energy trap, while her comrades from Universe 2 send their love to her. This allows Brianne to transform into a giant manifestation version of her Super Ribrianne form. No. 18 almost gives up until her love for Krillin and Marron gives her the determination to break free of Ribrianne's trap. With No. 17's help, No. 18 blasts through Ribrianne's giant form and eliminates her. Brianne realizes that she lost because of No. 18's strong love for Krillin, while Goku faces off against Zirloin (ザーロイン, Zāroin), Zarbuto, and Rabanra of Universe 2. \n\n\n118\n42\n\"Accelerated Tragedy Vanishing Universes...\"\n\"Kasokusuru Higeki Kieyuku Uchū...\" (加速する悲劇消えゆく宇宙...) \nDecember 3, 2017\nTBA\n\n\nGoku battles against Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra from Universe 2, while Gohan and Piccolo are fighting against Saonel and Pirina. Saonel and Pirina's power suddenly increases, and it is revealed that they had each fused with many Namekians from their universe before coming to the tournament, which greatly increased their own powers. No. 17 and No. 18 join Goku to help in the battle against the remaining Universe 2 warriors. It is revealed that Universe 2's angel, Sour (サワア, Sawaa), has been broadcasting the tournament to the populace of their universe. Universe 2's inhabitants channel their love to Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, who are able to transform into forms similar to Ribrianne, Rozie, and Kakunsa's transformed states. Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 battle Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo continue fighting Saonel and Pirina. The Universe 2 trio unleash a legendary Universe 2 technique, the Pretty Black Hole, which traps and threatens to sink Goku, No. 17, and No. 18 through the fighting stage. Goku powers up to Super Saiyan Blue and breaks through the Pretty Black Hole with a Kamehameha that eliminates Zirloin, Zarbuto, and Rabanra, while Gohan and Piccolo blast Saonel and Pirina off the ring with a powerful combined attack that eliminates them as well. With all of their fighters eliminated, both Universe 2 and Universe 6 are erased. Brianne leads the Universe 2 team in a final happy moment before their erasure, while Cabba wishes Vegeta good luck. Champa taunts Beerus before being erased. Beerus remains impassive in the face of his brother's erasure. Vegeta faces off against Katopesla and warns him that he is in a bad mood. \n\n\n119\n43\n\"Unavoidable?! The Fierce Stealth Attack!!\"\n\"Kaihi funō!?

Katopesla is able to catch himself, but he is pushed over the edge and eliminated by an unseen force. Vegeta and Gohan are attacked by the same force, but Vegeta is able to stop himself from going over the edge, while Piccolo catches Gohan. No. 18 is attacked by the invisible fighter, who is revealed to be one of the missing Universe 4 fighters, Gamisaras (ガミサラス, Gamisarasu). Gohan creates a cloud of dust that coats Gamisaras, which allows Piccolo to see him and then easily eliminates Gamisaras. Undaunted, Quitela orders the remaining Universe 4 fighters to step up their game. Shantza (シャンツァ, Shantsa) generates a dome that envelops the Universe 7 team and manifests illusions of the defeated fighters from the erased universes. However, Piccolo spots Shantza and blasts him off the ring, which eliminates him and destroys the illusions. Universe 4's last fighter, Damon (ダモン, Damon), is also assumed to be invisible since no one can see him. Piccolo is able to sense Damon's attacks, but he proves unable to hit Damon, who knocks him out of the ring and eliminates him. No. 17 discovers the truth and exposes Damon as a tiny bug-like creature rather than an invisible person, which explains why none of the fighters were able to hit him. To solve this problem, Goku repeatedly punches the ring and creates shock waves that launch Damon into the air, which cancels out his agility and allows No. 17 to hit him with energy blasts. No. 17 traps Damon in a miniature force field and kicks him out of the ring to eliminate him. With all of their fighters eliminated, Universe 4 is promptly erased. \n\n\n120\n44\n\"The Perfect Survival Tactic! Universe 3's Menacing Assassin!!\"\n\"Kanpeki na Seizon Senryaku!

While Viara is defeated and eliminated by No. 17 and No. 18's combined efforts, Paparoni (パパロニ, Paparoni) sends Panchia, Koitsukai, and Bollarator to attack Goku, Gohan, and Vegeta. To help Goku and Vegeta save their energy to confront Universe 11, Gohan decides to face the three robots alone. He gains the upper hand until Paparoni has them combine together into a much stronger robot called Koichiarator (コイチアレータ, Koichiarēta). Koichiarator overpowers Gohan until Goku and Vegeta step in. The two distract the enemy, while Gohan charges and strikes with an attack powerful enough to defeat it. With his robots defeated, Paparoni refuses to surrender and declares that he will unleash his trump card on Universe 7. \n\n\n121\n45\n\"All-Out War!

Anilaza begins to overwhelm the Saiyans, which forces No. 17 and No. 18 to reinforce them. The five attempt to coordinate their attacks to catch Anilaza off-guard, but he deflects them all. It is revealed that Anilaza can use echolocation to detect his opponents' movements. Anilaza begins teleporting his punches, and he nearly knocks Goku off the stage until Frieza steps in and knocks him back into the arena. Realizing that the Universe 7 warriors will rescue each other from defeat, Anilaza attempts to eat No. 18, who is rescued by Goku. Anilaza corners No. 17 and overwhelms him. He knocks him off the fighting stage, but No. 18 sacrifices herself to kick No. 17 back onto the fighting stage. She is eliminated from the tournament. With no other options, the Universe 7 warriors power up to their maximum levels and engage in a ki clash with Anilaza. They buy time for No. 17 to pierce through Anilaza's attack and damage his energy reactor. This enables the others to overwhelm and eliminate Anilaza. With all of their warriors eliminated, Universe 3 is erased. As the Universe 7 warriors begin to celebrate, the remaining Universe 11 warriors step forward to challenge them. \n\n\n122\n46\n\"For One's Own Pride!

Vegeta analyzes his patterns and dodges his attacks. He lands a solid blow to Jiren's midsection. Jiren counters with a powerful blast that nearly rings Vegeta out. Meanwhile, Frieza blocks one of Dyspo's attacks with his tail, but Dyspo uses it as leverage to injure him. Jiren disparages Vegeta for his self-righteousness, but Vegeta declares that it is the source of his strength. He powers up a Final Flash and goads Jiren into taking it head-on.

{"context": "Context: Animals are divided by body plan into vertebrates and invertebrates. Vertebrates—fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals—have a vertebral column (spine); invertebrates do not. All vertebrates and most invertebrates are bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateria). Invertebrates include arthropods, molluscs, roundworms, ringed worms, flatworms, and other phyla in Ecdysozoa and Spiralia. Echinoderm larvae are initially bilaterally symmetrical, but later as adults develop radial symmetry; Cnidarians are radially symmetrical; ctenophores are biradially symmetrical; and sponges have no symmetry.\nAll this suggests the deuterostomes and protostomes are separate, monophyletic lineages. The main phyla of deuterostomes are the Echinodermata and Chordata.[107] The former are radially symmetric and exclusively marine, such as starfish, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.[108] The latter are dominated by the vertebrates, animals with backbones.[109] These include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.[110]\n\nQuestion: distinctive characteristics of animals classified as vertebrates include\nAnswer:", "answer": "a vertebral column (spine)", "aliases": ["have a vertebral column (spine)", "have a vertebral column", "backbones"]}

After 1945 many states and cities east of the Mississippi River (and mostly north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers) adopted summer DST.[7]\n\n\nYear\nStart\nEnd\n\n\n2015\nMarch 8\nNovember 1\n\n\n2016\nMarch 13\nNovember 6\n\n\n2017\nMarch 12\nNovember 5\n\n\n2018\nMarch 11\nNovember 4\n\n\n2019\nMarch 10\nNovember 3\n\n\n2020\nMarch 8\nNovember 1\n\n\n2021\nMarch 14\nNovember 7\n\n\n2022\nMarch 13\nNovember 6\n\n\n2023\nMarch 12\nNovember 5\n\n\n2024\nMarch 10\nNovember 3\n\n\n\nQuestion: when did day light savings start in the us\nAnswer:", "answer": "March 11", "aliases": ["1918", "March 19, 1918", "March 31, 1918"]}

Some members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, commonly referred to as suffragettes) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women's suffrage. In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes. These suffragettes were then force-fed leading to a public outcry.[1] This act was a response to the outcry; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health. They then had a period of time in which they could recover. After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence. Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release.[2] The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal. However, the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges.

{"context": "Context: Criminal Law is the body of law that relates to crime. It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people. Most criminal law is established by statute, which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature. It includes the punishment of people who violate these laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation than on punishment.\n\nRetribution – Criminals ought to Be Punished in some way. This is the most widely seen goal. Criminals have taken improper advantage, or inflicted unfair detriment, upon others and consequently, the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to \"balance the scales.\" People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws, they surrender the rights granted to them by the law. Thus, one who murders may be executed himself. A related theory includes the idea of \"righting the balance.\"\nDeterrence – Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender. The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior. General deterrence aims at society at large. By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses, other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses.\nIncapacitation – Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct. This is often achieved through prison sentences today. The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose.\nRehabilitation – Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society. Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong.\nRestoration – This is a victim-oriented theory of punishment. The goal is to repair, through state authority, any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender. For example, one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired. Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law, i.e., returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury.\n\n\nQuestion: what is the main objective of criminal law\nAnswer:", "answer": "Rehabilitation", "aliases": ["proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people", "Retribution", "Incapacitation", "Deterrence", "Restoration"]}

This list in the Pauline letters of factors making Christians one body, one church, is doubtless not meant to be exhaustive, says Francis Aloysius Sullivan, but it affirms the oneness of the body, the church, through what Christians have in common, what they have communion in. Elsewhere, Paul the Apostle says: \"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus\" (Gal. 3:28). This statement was about Christians as individuals, but it applied to them also as groups, as local churches, whether composed mainly of Jewish or Gentile Christians. In 1 Cor. 15:9, Paul spoke of himself as having persecuted \"the church of God\", not just the local church in Jerusalem but the same church that he addresses at the beginning of that letter as \"the church of God that is in Corinth\" (1 Cor. 1:2). In the same letter, he tells Christians: \"You are the body of Christ and individually members of it\" (1 Cor. 12:27), and declares that, \"just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ\" (1 Cor. 12:12).[11][12]\n\nQuestion: what is meant by the church is one\nAnswer:", "answer": "the oneness of the body, the church, through what Christians have in common, what they have communion in", "aliases": []}
{"context": "Context: The most common type of megalithic construction in Europe is the portal tomb – a chamber consisting of upright stones (orthostats) with one or more large flat capstones forming a roof. Many of these, though by no means all, contain human remains, but it is debatable whether use as burial sites was their primary function. The megalithic structures of Malta are believed to be the oldest in Europe, in particular Skorba Temples. Though generally known as dolmens, the correct term accepted by archaeologists is portal tomb. However many local names exist, such as anta in Galicia and Portugal, stazzone in Sardinia, hunebed in the Netherlands, Hünengrab in Germany, dysse in Denmark, and cromlech in Wales.

Rising artists Valens and Richardson had joined the tour, as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of flu and even frostbite. After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by such conditions, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Richardson, who had the flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss. Soon after takeoff, late at night and in poor, wintry weather conditions, the pilot lost control of the light aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, which subsequently crashed into a cornfield. Everyone on board was killed. The event has since been mentioned in various songs and films.

{"context": "Context: Later dynasties adopted different policies towards northern frontier defense. The Han (202 BC – 220 AD), the Northern Qi (550–574), the Sui (589–618), and particularly the Ming (1369–1644) were among those that rebuilt, re-manned, and expanded the Walls, although they rarely followed Qin's routes. The Han extended the fortifications furthest to the west, the Qi built about 1,600 kilometres (990 mi) of new walls, while the Sui mobilised over a million men in their wall-building efforts. Conversely, the Tang (618–907), the Song (960–1279), the Yuan (1271–1368), and the Qing (1644–1911) mostly did not build frontier walls, instead opting for other solutions to the Inner Asian threat like military campaigning and diplomacy.\nThe Great Wall of China visible today largely dates from the Ming dynasty, as they rebuilt much of the wall in stone and brick, often extending its line through challenging terrain.[2] Some sections remain in relatively good condition or have been renovated, while others have been damaged or destroyed for ideological reasons,[3] deconstructed for their building materials,[3] or lost due to the ravages of time.[4] For long an object of fascination for foreigners, the wall is now a revered national symbol and a popular tourist destination.[5]\nThe history of the Great Wall of China began when fortifications built by various states during the Spring and Autumn (771–476 BC)[1] and Warring States periods (475–221 BC) were connected by the first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang, to protect his newly founded Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) against incursions by nomads from Inner Asia. The walls were built of rammed earth, constructed using forced labour, and by 212 BC ran from Gansu to the coast of southern Manchuria.\n\nQuestion: what dynasty completed the great wall of china\nAnswer:", "answer": "Qin", "aliases": ["Ming dynasty", "Qing"]}

The NFL contributes up to $5,000 per ring for up to 150 rings for o the winning team; any additional costs are borne by the team.[1] Most rings are manufactured by memorabilia company Jostens. In 2015, the rings for the New England Patriots reportedly cost $36,500 each, making them the most expensive rings Jostens has ever produced.[2] The winning team can typically present rings to whomever they choose, including usually, but not limited to: players (active roster or injured), coaches, trainers, executives, personnel, and general staff. Some teams have given rings to former players and coaches that were on the team at some point during the season, despite not having been on the winning roster for the Super Bowl itself.[3][4] Sometimes a team will give rings to fans as part of a charity raffle.[5] Teams can distribute any number of rings. A recent trend over the last 15–20 years has been lesser rings awarded to front office staff. These are commonly called \"B\" and \"C\" level rings and are smaller and contain fewer diamonds or contain faux diamonds. The first instance of this was the Redskins Super Bowl XVII ring when many in the front office received rings that were not solid gold and contained cubic zirconia stones (which resemble diamonds).

Against Iris' orders, Team Flash successfully returns Barry, who rambles random statements and continually writes symbols on the walls. Wally engages the samurai, but is defeated. Cisco deciphers Barry's writings and finds an apparently meaningless sentence. In an attempt to recover Barry's memories, Iris gives herself up to the samurai.

Harry informs Cisco that Jesse has expelled him from her crime-fighting team due to his attitude. Becky's powers expand out of control, reactivating the particle accelerator, which Harry deliberately allows, nullifying Becky's powers and leading to her incarceration.

Barry discovers the camera in the Samuroid head and goes to DeVoe's house, narrowly avoiding being caught by DeVoe's wife.

Once outside, they are rescued by Cisco and Ralph, as Iris has chosen to focus on finding Caitlin. Barry manages to escape from DeVoe. Team Flash celebrates Christmas at the West house and Dominic joins them. Barry gets a security alert from his apartment. When he arrives, he receives a phone call from Dominic, who reveals that Amunet re-kidnapped Dominic and DeVoe has transferred his consciousness into Dominic's body. Barry discovers DeVoe's original body dead on his apartment floor and he realizes DeVoe has framed him for his \"murder\"; the police arrive, and Barry lets himself get arrested, not wanting to leave Iris again.\n\n\n79\n10\n\"The Trial of The Flash\"\nPhilip Chipera\nLauren Certo & Kristen Kim\nJanuary 16, 2018 (2018-01-16)\nT27.13410\n2.51[11]\n\n\nBarry stands trial for the murder of Clifford DeVoe, with Cecile representing him. Cisco and Joe have to leave during the trial for a meta investigation, in which a meta caused people to collapse. Singh reveals to Joe he is appearing as a witness for the prosecution against Barry. The meta is eventually discovered as Neil Borman, who is a meta who produces radiation, which is causing the illness and collapsing. Barry takes him on, but is ill equipped to deal with the situation. Cisco and Killer Frost travel to the scene where Caitlin tries to freeze Borman, who quickly defrosts and incapacitates Caitlin. Barry creates a vacuum seal around Borman to contain the radiation, with Cisco transporting the radiation to the dead Earth-15, draining the meta and defeating him. Barry is eventually found guilty by the jury and is sentenced to life in prison.\n\n\n80\n11\n\"The Elongated Knight Rises\"\nAlexandra La Roche\nSterling Gates & Thomas Pound\nJanuary 23, 2018 (2018-01-23)\nT27.13411\n2.12[12]\n\n\nBarry uses his speed to secretly help the guards contain the other inmates during a prison riot. He also befriends Dave Ratchet, his father's former cellmate. The next day, Barry meets Axel Walker who was later broken out of prison by his mother Zoey Clark, his father's one-time partner Prank. Axel challenges Ralph by threatening to cause chaos in the city. Ralph attempts to stop him but is wounded by Axel and is evacuated by Cisco. Ralph sneaks into the prison to talk to Barry about how scared he is. Barry reassures him that being a hero isn't about not being scared, but about having the ability to rise above your fear. Cisco and Caitlin go to rescue the hostages, but get captured by Axel and Zoey, who intend to kill them. Ralph arrives, and attempts to shield the two from an acid shower, until Wells manages to hack into the shower system to neutralize its acidity. Iris visits Barry in prison, where they reaffirm their love for each other. Ralph and Cisco go to get coffee, where they meet the excitable girl from the wedding. The girl writes in her journal, where she appears to be writing in the language Barry was using when he came out of the Speed Force.\n\n\n81\n12\n\"Honey, I Shrunk Team Flash\"\nChris Peppe\nSam Chalsen & Judalina Neira\nJanuary 30, 2018 (2018-01-30)\nT27.13412\n2.60[13]\n\n\nCecile develops telepathic abilities as a result of her pregnancy, combined with dormant dark matter in her cells, which Caitlin assures her should be temporary. In prison, Barry learns that Ratchet is innocent of a robbery-homicide that was actually committed by Sylbert Rundine fifteen years prior. Barry asks the team to look into the case. Rundine turns out to be a bus meta with the ability to shrink and enlarge objects, and he shrinks Cisco and Ralph while escaping. Harry's attempted cure backfires, and Caitlin determines that if they are not re-enlarged within a certain period of time, their bodies will explode. The team confronts Rundine at a warehouse, where Harry tricks him into re-enlarging Ralph and Cisco. Rundine is arrested, but refuses to confess to the earlier crime. Barry gathers that even if Ratchet went free, he would be as unhappy in the city as he is in prison; he wishes to live in a secluded Chinese village called Jiaju, but fears he will never get there. Barry then uses his speed to take Ratchet to Jiaju, where he can live out his dream. After discovering Barry is the Flash, the prison's warden, Gregory Wolfe, locks Barry in his private metahuman wing, intending to sell him to Amunet.\n\n\n82\n13\n\"True Colors\"\nTara Nicole Weyr\nJonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza\nFebruary 6, 2018 (2018-02-06)\nT27.13413\n2.28[14]\n\n\nWolfe plans to sell Barry and the imprisoned bus metas (Ramsey Deacon, Becky Sharpe, Mina Chaytan, and Sylbert Rundine) to Amunet, so they plan to escape. Cecile discovers Wolfe's plans after reading his mind. Ralph encounters a former colleague and his negative interaction with him prompts the discovery that he can shapeshift. His lack of mastery of the new ability prevents his attempt to foil Amunet's deal with Wolfe. Barry helps the metas escape the power dampeners, but they are cornered by Wolfe and Amunet. DeVoe arrives and again uses his chair to extract the metas' abilities, before transferring his mind into Sharpe's body. He then crushes Wolfe's skull as Marlize looks on in horror; Amunet flees. Ralph uses his shapeshifting ability to appear as the original DeVoe at Barry's appeal, claiming that he was unconscious at Barry's loft but not dead, which clears Barry's name. Team Flash realizes that DeVoe is only stealing powers from metahumans who were on the bus when the dark matter wave was unleashed, which means he will likely target Ralph as well. Back at the DeVoes' house, their marriage continues to deteriorate, and DeVoe drugs his wife with the Weeper's tears to maintain her devotion towards him.\n\n\n83\n14\n\"Subject 9\"\nRalph Hemecker\nMike Alber & Gabe Snyder\nFebruary 27, 2018 (2018-02-27)\nT27.13414\n2.12[15]\n\n\nBarry is put on indefinite leave at the CCPD due to his connection with the DeVoe case. The team encounter another bus metahuman named Izzy with sound wave abilities, amplified by her violin. She manages to use her abilities when DeVoe (inside Sharpe's body) comes to claim her. Barry and Ralph help to train Izzy to refine her abilities, which proves difficult when she gets hurt. Eventually DeVoe shows up once again, using Dominic's and Becky's abilities to make Barry experience a brain aneurysm, while using Rundine's abilities to incapacitate Ralph. DeVoe then once again uses the chair to transfer his mind into Izzy's body and escapes. Both Ralph and Barry comfort each other over their respective losses: Barry being let go from the police force and Ralph losing Izzy to DeVoe. These losses enforce both Barry's and Ralph's determination to bring DeVoe down and save the three remaining metas.\n\n\n84\n15\n\"Enter Flashtime\"\nGregory Smith\nTodd Helbing & Sterling Gates\nMarch 6, 2018 (2018-03-06)\nT27.13415\n2.04[16]\n\n\nJesse comes to Earth-1 to have a talk with her dad. Eco-terrorist Veronica Dale sets off a nuclear bomb, which Barry tries to stop, entering a form of superspeed known as Flashtime, where everything is frozen. However, the bomb has already detonated, and he and Jesse cannot stop it or save everyone with superspeed. Jay Garrick comes from Earth-3 to help, but they are still unable to stop it. Barry remains in Flashtime for hours, bringing each of his friends into it, in an attempt to find a solution; they discuss options such as freezing it or sending it to another Earth, but none of those solutions prove to be viable. Eventually, Iris gives him the idea to retrieve the Quark Sphere from the Speed Force to send a blast lightning through the bomb, enough to disable it. Barry does so, and throws the Sphere back into the Speed Force, saving Central City. Jay admits he is retiring and going to train a new \"female\" speedster. Jesse and Jay return to their Earths, and Caitlin and Wells go for a coffee, where they encounter the mysterious girl.\n\n\n85\n16\n\"Run, Iris, Run\"\nHarry Jierjian\nEric Wallace\nMarch 13, 2018 (2018-03-13)\nT27.13416\n2.09[17]\n\n\nA metahuman with fire powers tries to rob Central City bank. Another bus meta named Matthew Kim touches the metahuman, which causes his powers to transfer to another individual. When Joe, Iris and Barry turn up to ask Kim a few questions, Barry and Iris come into contact with Kim, causing Barry to lose his speed and Iris to gain superspeed. Inspired by Thawne, Harry plans to build his own thinking cap to outwit DeVoe. With their roles reversed, Iris becomes Central City's hero speedster, while Barry must learn to act as team leader. The new metahuman demands money and terrorizes the city with his fire powers. Using Wells' thinking cap, the Team comes up with the idea for Iris to create a tidal wave, negating the flames and defeating the meta. Back at S.T.A.R. Labs, Kim touches Iris and Barry again, restoring the Flash's speed. At home, Iris admits that while she did enjoy having superspeed, Central City needs the light that Barry was, and she is happy being team leader. Wells uses his thinking cap once more, determining the final two bus metas are Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.\n\n\n86\n17\n\"Null and Annoyed\"\nKevin Smith\nLauren Certo & Kristen Kim\nApril 10, 2018 (2018-04-10)\nT27.13417\n1.82[18]\n\n\nBarry and Ralph train to defeat DeVoe, with Barry becoming annoyed at Ralph's apparent inability to be serious. The team manages to locate another bus meta, Janet Petty. When Barry and Ralph confront her, it is revealed that Petty can manipulate a person's gravitational pull, which she demonstrates on Barry. Fearing once again that Ralph is not taking things seriously, Barry refuses to work with him. Ralph reveals his comedic attitude is due to a difficult childhood where his father abandoned him, causing him to make jokes whenever he is scared or under pressure. Barry relents and they go to stop Janet at a gala event. Janet uses her powers on Barry, causing him to float into the atmosphere. Barry tells the team to trust Ralph to improvise. Ralph detains Janet, then becomes a giant airbag to allow Barry to land safely. DeVoe's wife discovers he has been drugging her, so she will continue to assist him. Breacher comes to Earth-1 to ask Cisco for help as some of his powers have failed. Harry takes the thinking cap to Thawne's time vault to recharge it and activates Gideon.\n\n\n87\n18\n\"Lose Yourself\"\nHanelle Culpepper\nJonathan Butler & Gabriel Garza\nApril 17, 2018 (2018-04-17)\nT27.13418\n1.88[19]\n\n\nTeam Flash track down the final bus meta Edwin Gauss, but are followed by the Samuroid, who injures Caitlin. The team rush back to Star Labs to regroup and heal. Caitlin reveals to Iris that Killer Frost is activated by her adrenal gland, and she is working on a way to separate them. Harry comes up with a tuning fork weapon that mimics Izzy's abilities in order to defeat DeVoe. Ralph reveals to Barry that he isn't afraid of losing his own life, but of Team Flash losing theirs, as he considers them family. Wells is shown to be addicted to the Thinking Cap, which Joe helps him deal with. Ralph takes the fork, with the intent to go with Edwin to kill DeVoe, which Barry argues against. Eventually, DeVoe manages to take over Edwin's mind, and as well takes the abilities of Janet Petty and Matthew Kim, before transferring his mind into Ralph's body. The team try to stop him, but DeVoe incapacitates them, and alters Caitlin's DNA, removing the dark matter and Killer Frost, before leaving. Back at his lair, DeVoe uses Ralph's morphing abilities to morph back into his original form, while he and Marlize plan their next move to destroy Team Flash.\n\n\n88\n19\n\"Fury Rogue\"\nRachel Talalay\nJoshua V.

Barry and Cisco travel to Earth X to recruit Leo Snart as a backup, but are followed to Earth 1 by the Earth X doppelganger of Laurel Lance. Team Flash plan to deliver Borman to a safe ARGUS facility, using a suit to contain the radiation, with Snart on hand, in case Borman goes nuclear. Snart agrees to help, but claims he can only stay for 24 hours, as he is due to get married to Ray Terrill. DeVoe attempts to intercept the transfer, but he and Team Flash are further ambushed by Earth X Laurel, who kidnaps Caitlin, Borman and Joe, holding them at CCPD. Snart learns about Ralph, and convinces Barry to allow himself to grieve his fallen allies, which Barry eventually does, giving him strength to defeat Laurel. Lyla transfers Borman to another facility and Leo returns to Earth X. Cisco and Wells come up with a plan to boost Wells' thinking cap. Devoe goes more into his \"god-complex\"; stating that human emotion is a weakness, causing Marlize to doubt him.\n\n\n89\n20\n\"Therefore She Is\"[21]\nRob J.

{"context": "Context: The American entry into World War I came in April 1917, after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war. Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British, American public opinion reflected that of the president: the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans, German Americans and Scandinavian Americans,[1] as well as among church leaders and among women in general. On the other hand, even before World War I had broken out, American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe.[2] Over time, especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915, the American citizens increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe.\nIn 1917, with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war, and with Britain and France low on credit, Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe,[3] while Germany's ally, the Ottoman Empire, clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East. In the same year, Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approaching British waters; this attempt to starve Britain into surrender was balanced against the knowledge that it would almost certainly bring the United States into the war. Germany also made a secret offer to help Mexico regain territories lost in the Mexican–American War in an encoded telegram known as the Zimmermann Telegram, which was intercepted by British Intelligence. Publication of that communique outraged Americans just as German U-boats started sinking American merchant ships in the North Atlantic. Wilson then asked Congress for \"a war to end all wars\" that would \"make the world safe for democracy\", and Congress voted to declare war on Germany on April 6, 1917.[4]\n\nQuestion: when did the usa join world war one\nAnswer:", "answer": "in April 1917", "aliases": ["April 6, 1917", "April 1917"]}

Yet no one in town tells him where the major is. A rich man threatens the youth with prison, and an innkeeper calls him a runaway bond-servant. At the inn, he meets a man with a face described as looking like the devil - two protrusions emanating from his forehead (like horns), eyes burning like 'fire in a cave'- who seems at the center of many evil things. Later, he runs into the man again, but this time his face is painted black and red. After blocking his path with a cudgel, he finally gets the answer that his kinsman will soon pass by. He waits at the spot on the steps of a church where he is greeted by the first polite gentleman he has met all night. Soon, the two men hear the roar of an approaching mob. At its head is the man with the red and black face and in its midst is Major Molineux, tarred and feathered. The crowd is in an uproar, and everyone is laughing. Soon, so is young Robin, as his eyes meet those of the Major, who knows him right away. Disillusioned, the youth asks the gentleman the way back to the ferry.

{"context": "Context: In 1989, the Hawke Labor Government began gradually re-introducing fees for university study. It set up the Higher Education Contributions Scheme (HECS),[5] which was first proposed by Professor Murray Wells [6] and subsequently developed by economist and lecturer at the Australian National University, Bruce Chapman and championed by Education Minister John Dawkins (see Dawkins Revolution). Under the original HECS, a $1,800 fee was charged to all university students, and the Commonwealth paid the balance. A student could defer payment of this HECS amount (in which case it was called a HECS debt) and repay the debt through the tax system, when the student's income exceeds a threshold level. As part of the reforms, Colleges of Advanced Education entered the University sector by various means.

{"context": "Context: In modern times, the U.S. military plays (or sounds) \"Reveille\" in the morning, generally near sunrise, though its exact time varies from base to base. On U.S. Army posts and Air Force bases, \"Reveille\" is played by itself or followed by the bugle call \"To the Colors\" at which time the national flag is raised and all U.S. military personnel outdoors are required to come to attention and present a salute in uniform, either to the flag or in the direction of the music if the flag is not visible. While in formation, soldiers are brought to the position of parade rest while \"Reveille\" plays then called to attention and present arms as the national flag is raised.

{"context": "Context: South Africa experiences a high degree of sunshine with rainfall about half of the global average, increasing from west to east, and with semi-desert regions in the north-west. While the Western Cape has a Mediterranean climate with winter rainfall, most of the country experiences summer rain.\nSouth Africa is a sunny country, averaging 8-10 daily sunshine hours in most regions.[2] The average annual rainfall for South Africa is 450ml(compared to a global average of 860ml) but large and unpredictable variations are common. Overall, rainfall is greatest in the east and gradually decreases westward, with some semi-desert areas along the western edge of South Africa. For most of the country, rain falls mainly in the summer months with brief afternoon thunderstorms. The exception is the Western Cape and its capital city Cape Town where the climate is Mediterranean and it rains more in the wintertime.[3]In the winter months, snow collects on the high mountains of the Cape and the Drakensberg.\n\nQuestion: during which season does cape town receive rainfall\nAnswer:", "answer": "summer", "aliases": ["winter"]}
{"context": "Context: The Dust Bowl, also known as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and agriculture of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years.[1] With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (250 mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.[2]\n\nQuestion: when did the dust bowl end in oklahoma\nAnswer:", "answer": "1940", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus, bearing distinctive fatty deposits known as \"humps\" on its back. The three surviving species of camel are the dromedary, or one-humped camel (C. dromedarius), which inhabits the Middle East and the Horn of Africa; the Bactrian, or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus), which inhabits Central Asia; and the critically endangered wild Bactrian camel (C. ferus) that has limited populations in remote areas of northwest China and Mongolia. Bactrian camels take their name from the historical Bactria region of Central Asia. Additionally one other species of camel [3] in the separate genus Camelops, C. hesternus [4] lived in western North America and became extinct when humans entered the continent at the end of the Pleistocene. Both the dromedary and the Bactrian camels have been domesticated; they provide milk, meat, hair for textiles or goods such as felted pouches, and are working animals with tasks ranging from human transport to bearing loads.\n\nQuestion: what is the name of a camel with 2 humps\nAnswer:", "answer": "the Bactrian", "aliases": ["Bactrian, or two-humped camel (C. bactrianus)", "Bactrian"]}

{"context": "Context: In the Romantic period, music became more expressive and emotional, expanding to encompass literary, artistic, and philosophical themes. Famous early Romantic composers include Beethoven (whose works span both this period and the preceding Classical period), Schubert, Schumann, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Bellini, and Berlioz. The late 19th century saw a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble. Also, public concerts became a key part of urban middle class society, in contrast to earlier periods, when concerts were mainly paid for by and performed for aristocrats. Famous composers from the second half of the century include Bruckner, Johann Strauss II, Brahms, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Dvořák, Verdi, and Wagner. Between 1890 and 1910, a third wave of composers including Mahler, Richard Strauss, Puccini, and Sibelius built on the work of middle Romantic composers to create even more complex – and often much longer – musical works. A prominent mark of late 19th century music is its nationalistic fervor, as exemplified by such figures as Dvořák, Sibelius, and Grieg. Other prominent late-century figures include Saint-Saëns, Fauré, Rachmaninoff and Franck.\n\nQuestion: how did orchestra change in the romantic period\nAnswer:", "answer": "a dramatic expansion in the size of the orchestra and in the dynamic range and diversity of instruments used in this ensemble", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The play was received with mixed results upon its release. The play was translated by Reverend J.Long for which he was sentenced to prison and charged with sedition.[2]\n\nJames Long believed that the British mercantile community and even the Government unjustly and oppressively treated the Indigo cultivators. His view concurred with Dinabandhu Mitra who expressed his sentiments in a play entitled Nil Darpan (the original Bengali play was written by him) and published anonymously from Dhaka in 1860. Mitra sent Long a copy of the play as early as 1861. Long brought it to the notice of W. S Seton-Karr, Secretary to the Governor of Bengal and ex-President of the Indigo Commission. Seton-Karr, sensing its importance, mentioned Nil Durpan in conversation with the Lieutenant Governor, Grant.Grant expressed a wish to see a translation of it and print a few copies to be circulated privately amongst friends. After the discussion, Seton-Karr asked Long to arrange for a translation of the play in English. Michael Madhusudan Dutta translated it under the supervision of Long. Long as the editor cut out some coarse passages and wrote a short prefatory note for the play. When the translation was complete, Seton-Karr ordered printing of five hundred copies in lieu of Grant's wish of a few copies. Then Long sent the translated manuscripts to Clement Henry Manuel, the proprietor of the Calcutta Printing and Publishing Press to print five hundred copies and the cost came to around Rs.300. It was published in April or May 1861. Unknown to the Lieutenant Governor, Long began sending out the copies in official Government envelopes that had the heading: \"on her Majesty's Service\".[5] The translation revealed the nature of the oppression against the indigo planters. It naturally offended the establishment of the play so much that a razing propaganda was started by the Anglo-Indian Press against the publisher and the translator. One of the leading newspapers named The Englishmen and some indigo planters instituted a libel suit against Long and the printer- C. H. Manuel. The words mentioned in Long's Introduction to the play stated that what was presented in it was \"plain but true\". This was subsequently used by the planters in their prosecution of Long for publishing defamatory statements.\n\n\nQuestion: who translated the play neel darpan into english\nAnswer:", "answer": "Michael Madhusudan Dutta", "aliases": ["Reverend J.Long"]}
{"context": "Context: Combustion /kəmˈbʌs.tʃən/ or burning[1] is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as wood and coal, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines. This reaction releases 242 kJ/mol of heat and reduces the enthalpy accordingly (at constant temperature and pressure):\n\nQuestion: what must be present for a combustion reaction to occur\nAnswer:", "answer": "a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant", "aliases": ["an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen", "a fuel (the reductant)"]}

{"context": "Context: A thin film is a layer of material ranging from fractions of a nanometer (monolayer) to several micrometers in thickness. The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films (a process referred to as deposition) is a fundamental step in many applications. A familiar example is the household mirror, which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface. The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors, while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering. Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media, electronic semiconductor devices, LEDs, optical coatings (such as antireflective coatings), hard coatings on cutting tools, and for both energy generation (e.g. thin-film solar cells) and storage (thin-film batteries). It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals, via thin-film drug delivery.

The succession follows the order of Vice President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, President pro tempore of the Senate, and then the heads of federal executive departments who form the Cabinet of the United States. The Cabinet currently has fifteen members, beginning with the Secretary of State, and followed by the rest in the order of their positions' creation.

{"context": "Context: Hector was a ship famous for having been part of the first significant migration of Scottish settlers to Nova Scotia in 1773. The replica of the original ship is located at the Hector Heritage Quay, a heritage center run by local volunteers, in Pictou.[1]\nIn 1762 the earliest of the Fuadaich nan Gàidheal (Scottish Highland Clearances) forced many Gaelic families off their ancestral lands. The first ship loaded with Hebridean colonists arrived on \"St.-John's Island\" (Prince Edward Island) in 1770, with later ships following in 1772, and 1774.[3] In 1773 a ship named The Hector landed in Pictou, Nova Scotia, with 189 settlers, mostly originating from Lochbroom.[4] In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement – a law restricting land-ownership on Cape Breton Island – was repealed, and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic-speaking.[5] It is estimated more than 50,000 Gaelic settlers emigrated to Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island between 1815 and 1870.[3]\n\nQuestion: when did the ship hector arrived in pictou\nAnswer:", "answer": "1773", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The Nativity stories of Matthew and Luke are prominent in the gospels and early Christian writers suggested various dates for the anniversary. The first recorded Christmas celebration was in Rome in 336.[45][46] Christmas played a role in the Arian controversy of the fourth century. In the early Middle Ages, it was overshadowed by Epiphany. The feast regained prominence after 800, when Charlemagne was crowned emperor on Christmas Day.\nAlthough the month and date of Jesus' birth are unknown, by the early-to-mid fourth century the Western Christian Church had placed Christmas on December 25,[23] a date that was later adopted in the East.[24][25] Today, most Christians celebrate on December 25 in the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. However, some Eastern Christian Churches celebrate Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7 in the Gregorian calendar, the day after the Western Christian Church celebrates the Epiphany. This is not a disagreement over the date of Christmas as such, but rather a preference of which calendar should be used to determine the day that is December 25. Moreover, for Christians, the belief that God came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than the exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating Christmas.[26][27][28][29]\n\nQuestion: when was christmas first celebrated as a holiday\nAnswer:", "answer": "early-to-mid fourth century", "aliases": ["336"]}

{"context": "Context: The concept of the paradise garden (charbagh) was brought from Persia by the Mughals as a form of Timurid garden. They were the first architectural expression the new empire made in the Indian sub-continent, and fulfilled diverse functions with strong symbolic meanings. The symbolism of these gardens is derived from mystic Islamic texts describing paradise as a garden filled with abundant trees, flowers and plants, with water playing a key role: In Paradise four rivers source at a central spring or mountain. In their ideal form they were laid out as a square subdivided into four equal parts. These rivers are often represented in the charbagh as shallow canals which separate the garden by flowing towards the cardinal points. The canals represent the promise of water, milk, wine and honey.[16] The centre of the garden, at the intersection of the divisions is highly symbolically charged and is where, in the ideal form, a pavilion, pool or tomb would be situated. The tombs of Humayun, Akbar and Jahangir, the previous Mughal emperors, follow this pattern. The cross axial garden also finds independent precedents within South Asia dating from the 5th century where the royal gardens of Sigiriya in Sri Lanka were laid out in a similar way.[17]\n\nQuestion: the taj mahal served as an example of aesthetic value for this kind of function\nAnswer:", "answer": "the paradise garden (charbagh)", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: Cooling towers originated in the 19th century through the development of condensers for use with the steam engine.[2] Condensers use relatively cool water, via various means, to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines. This reduces the back pressure, which in turn reduces the steam consumption, and thus the fuel consumption, while at the same time increasing power and recycling boiler-water.[3] However the condensers require an ample supply of cooling water, without which they are impractical.[4][5] The consumption of cooling water by inland processing and power plants is estimated to reduce power availability for the majority of thermal power plants by 2040–2069.[6] While water usage is not an issue with marine engines, it forms a significant limitation for many land-based systems.\n\nQuestion: why does cooling water run through the condenser\nAnswer:", "answer": "to condense the steam coming out of the cylinders or turbines", "aliases": ["condense the steam"]}
{"context": "Context: Chromosomes are normally visible under a light microscope only when the cell is undergoing the metaphase of cell division (where all chromosomes are aligned in the center of the cell in their condensed form).[3] Before this happens, every chromosome is copied once (S phase), and the copy is joined to the original by a centromere, resulting either in an X-shaped structure (pictured to the right) if the centromere is located in the middle of the chromosome or a two-arm structure if the centromere is located near one of the ends. The original chromosome and the copy are now called sister chromatids. During metaphase the X-shape structure is called a metaphase chromosome.

{"context": "Context: The history of Hawaii's economy can be traced through a succession of dominant industries; sandalwood,[140] whaling,[141] sugarcane, pineapple, the military, tourism and education. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the gross state product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The state's gross output for 2003 was US$47 billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents in 2014 was US$54,516.[142] Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, due to the shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. The state's food exports include coffee, macadamia nuts, pineapple, livestock, sugarcane and honey.[143]\nBy weight, honey bees may be the state's most valuable export.[144] According to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, agricultural sales were US$370.9 million from diversified agriculture, US$100.6 million from pineapple, and US$64.3 million from sugarcane. Hawaii's relatively consistent climate has attracted the seed industry, which is able to test three generations of crops per year on the islands, compared with one or two on the mainland.[145] Seeds yielded US$264 million in 2012, supporting 1,400 workers.[146]\n\nQuestion: what was hawaii's primary export to the united states\nAnswer:", "answer": "honey", "aliases": ["sugarcane", "macadamia nuts", "coffee", "livestock", "pineapple"]}

{"context": "Context: The railway was originally built between Eastern Canada and British Columbia between 1881 and 1885 (connecting with Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay area lines built earlier), fulfilling a promise extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871. It was Canada's first transcontinental railway, but no longer reaches the Atlantic coast. Primarily a freight railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long-distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada. The CPR became one of the largest and most powerful companies in Canada, a position it held as late as 1975.[3] Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986, after being assumed by Via Rail Canada in 1978. A beaver was chosen as the railway's logo in honor of Sir Donald A Smith (1st. Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal) who had risen from Factor to Govenor of the Hudson's Bay Company over a lengthy career in the beaver fur trade . Smith was a principal financier of the C.P.R. staking much of his personal wealth.

{"context": "Context: Earlier theories (e.g. by Alfred Wegener and Alexander du Toit) of continental drift postulated that continents \"ploughed\" through the sea. The idea that the seafloor itself moves (and also carries the continents with it) as it expands from a central axis was proposed by Harry Hess from Princeton University in the 1960s.[4] The theory is well accepted now, and the phenomenon is known to be caused by convection currents in the asthenosphere, which is ductile, or  plastic, and the brittle lithosphere (crust and upper mantle).[5][clarification needed]\n\nSince then, it has been shown that the motion of the continents is linked to seafloor spreading by the theory of plate tectonics. In the 1960s, the past record of geomagnetic reversals was noticed by observing the magnetic stripe \"anomalies\" on the ocean floor.[13] This results in broadly evident \"stripes\" from which the past magnetic field polarity can be inferred by looking at the data gathered from simply towing a magnetometer on the sea surface or from an aircraft. The stripes on one side of the mid-ocean ridge were the mirror image of those on the other side. The seafloor must have originated on the Earth's great fiery welts, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the East Pacific Rise.\n\n\nQuestion: what observation led to the theory of seafloor spreading\nAnswer:", "answer": "that continents \"ploughed\" through the sea.", "aliases": ["magnetic stripe \"anomalies\" on the ocean floor"]}

Some consider his statement to be reliable. Mrs. Dick had left by lifeboat an hour and 20 minutes earlier and could not possibly have heard the band's final moments. The notion that the band played \"Nearer, My God, to Thee\" as a swan song is possibly a myth originating from the wrecking of SS Valencia, which had received wide press coverage in Canada in 1906 and so may have influenced Mrs. Dick's recollection.[2]\n\nQuestion: what song did the titanic band play when it sank\nAnswer:", "answer": "\"Autumn\"", "aliases": []}

Irsay agreed, which set a chain of events into motion that would bring about the move.[17]\nThe Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis was a successful effort by the then-owner of the Baltimore Colts (Robert Irsay) to move the American football team from Baltimore, Maryland to Indianapolis, Indiana. The team began play as the Indianapolis Colts for the 1984 National Football League (NFL) season. The Colts' move was completely unannounced and occurred in the early hours of March 29, 1984, after years of lobbying for a new stadium to replace the inadequate Memorial Stadium.

{"context": "Context: Other names for the vascular cambium are the main cambium, wood cambium, or bifacial cambium. In more detail, the vascular cambium is a plant tissue located between the xylem and the phloem in the stems and roots of certain vascular plants.[1]:125 It is a cylinder of unspecialized meristem cells that divide to form secondary vascular tissues. It is the source of both secondary xylem growth inwards towards the pith,[2] and secondary phloem growth outwards to the bark. Unlike the xylem and phloem, it does not transport water, minerals or food through the plant.[2]\nThe vascular cambium is the main growth layer in the stems and roots of many plants, specifically in dicots such as buttercups and oak trees, and gymnosperms such as pine trees. It produces xylem on the inside and phloem on the outside. In herbaceous plants, it occurs in the vascular bundles which are often arranged like beads on a necklace forming an interrupted ring inside the stem.

However, on a trip to Louisiana, Smith saw a drive-in that used speakers for ordering.

Smith borrowed several automobiles from a friend who owned a used-car lot to establish a layout for controlled parking. He also had some so-called \"jukebox boys\" come in and wire an intercom system in the parking lot. Sales immediately tripled.

{"context": "Context: The show is broadcast live on BBC One on Saturday evenings, and is currently presented by Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman (however Zoë Ball covered for Winkleman for a number of weeks in 2014). Sir Bruce Forsyth presented the live shows alongside Daly from 2004 to 2013, announcing his departure in 2014. He was to continue to present special editions of the show.[16] For some of the second series, Natasha Kaplinsky stood in temporarily for Daly while she took maternity leave; Claudia Winkleman hosted the results show and editions that Forsyth had missed between 2010 and 2013. The judging panel initially consisted of Bruno Tonioli, Arlene Phillips, Len Goodman and Craig Revel Horwood. Alesha Dixon took Phillips' place from series 7 to 9, after which she left the programme to judge Britain's Got Talent which led retired ballerina Dame Darcey Bussell to replace her; Bussell remains a judge alongside Tonioli and Revel Horwood.[17] Tonioli commutes weekly between Hollywood and London to judge both the American and British versions of the show simultaneously. Each judge gives the performance a mark out of ten, giving an overall total out of forty. The voice-over announcer is Alan Dedicoat. During series four, an hour-long highlights show was shown on Sundays at 19:00 on BBC Two, and during series five and six, the results show moved to Sunday evenings, although it was filmed on Saturday and then broadcast \"as live\" on the Sunday.\nThe show has run on BBC One since 15 May 2004, primarily on Saturday evenings with a following Sunday night results show (with certain exceptions) and with its high viewing figures Strictly Come Dancing has become a significant programme in British popular culture.[citation needed] The thirteenth series ended on 19 December 2015. A further eleven stand-alone Christmas specials have also been produced, in consecutive years from 2004 onwards. Nine charity specials have also been produced since 2008. Since the fourth series, the show has also been aired in high definition on BBC HD, and BBC One HD from series 8.\nFrom Series 5 onwards, the results show is recorded on the Saturday night directly after the live show and incorporates the result of the viewers' votes which are completed by 21:30.

Written and composed by lead vocalist Bart Millard, the song, based around a main piano track, was inspired by the death of Millard's father and considers what it would be like in Heaven and to be standing before God. The song was first issued as a track on MercyMe's 1999 album The Worship Project, which was released on an independent record label. The song was re-recorded and included on their 2001 major-label debut album Almost There as the fifth song on the album.\n\"I Can Only Imagine\" was released in 2001 as the album's lead single. It gained significant airplay on Christian radio formats before crossing over to mainstream radio formats such as adult contemporary and Top 40 in late 2003 and into 2004; to aid in promotion to these markets, a double A-side physical single (combined with \"Word of God Speak\") was released in 2003. It charted on several formats, including the Billboard Adult Contemporary (where it peaked at No. 5) and the Hot 100 (where it peaked at No. 71). In 2002, \"I Can Only Imagine\" earned the Dove Awards for 'Pop/Contemporary Recorded Song of the Year' and 'Song of the Year'; Millard earned the Dove Award 'Songwriter of the Year' at the same ceremony.

While in prison, Mark discovered an extinction event from a temperature shift in Northern Norway. In order to prevent mass extinction, the team has to work with the mad genius to stop methane from leaking through cracks in the ice caused by an earthquake. However, methane geysers are created during an aftershock and, if not plugged up, will start warming the earth's atmosphere within hours instead of weeks. During the mission, Walter and Paige awkwardly resume their new relationship at work, causing Walter to burst out into song and dance.

Despite some issues, the team succeeds in stealing the necessary supplies and successfully freezes over the methane hotspots, buying the needed time for specialists to come with methane-eating bacteria to remove the threat completely. However, Collins tricks Cabe and is able to escape. In the aftermath, the team comes to realize that Collins had planned all along to use the extinction event to escape and Cabe is arrested for instigating Collins' escape.

With four hours until help arrives and the fuel vapors threatening to cause the warhead to detonate, Scorpion comes up with a plan to use a 3D printer and neon gas to create a plug for the leak. A mistake in the gas they receive causes the situation to worsen, so Walter decides to use an explosion to harmlessly launch the warhead into the countryside, where it can safely be recovered later. While the launch is successful, the vapors arm the warhead. At the last second, Happy disarms it and Scorpion leaves the Air Force to clean up the mess.

Due to a malfunction, one such ship ends up a disastrous collision course with a refinery and the team's attempts to stop it make the situation worse. Finally, Walter manages to board the ship, but is unable to stop it directly due to its damaged electronics.

At the same time, Cabe goes on trial for aiding and abetting Mark Collins' escape and taking a bribe. Cabe's trial is a bench trial overseen by a judge with a history of handing down harsh sentences. The judge rejects most of Sly's defenses making it seem like Cabe will be convicted. However, Sly has a last minute idea using an obscure case from 1804 and maritime law. Ultimately, the judge dismisses the bribery charges based on evidence presented by Sly of Collins' bank hacking to frame Cabe. Based on maritime law, Cabe is exonerated for helping Collins escape and is released.

Nevertheless, popular opinion in the U.S., fanned by inflammatory articles printed in the \"yellow press\" by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, blamed Spain. The phrase, \"Remember the Maine! To hell with Spain!\", became a rallying cry for action, which came with the Spanish–American War later that year.

Astin, who had recently become a father, bonded with the 18-year-old Wood in a protective manner, which mirrored Sam's relationship with Frodo.[8]\nViggo Mortensen as Aragorn II Elessar: a Dúnedain ranger, the descendant of Isildur, and heir to Gondor's throne. Daniel Day-Lewis was offered the part at the beginning of pre-production, but turned it down.[17] Nicolas Cage also received an offer, declining because of \"family obligations\",[18] while Vin Diesel, a fan of the book, auditioned for Aragorn. Stuart Townsend was cast in the role, before being replaced during filming when Jackson realised he was too young.[13] Russell Crowe was considered as a replacement, but he turned it down after taking what he thought to be a similar role in Gladiator.[13] Day-Lewis was offered the role for a second time, but declined again.[17] Executive Producer Mark Ordesky saw Mortensen in a play. Mortensen's son, a fan of the book, convinced him to take the role.[8] Mortensen read the book on the plane, received a crash course lesson in fencing from Bob Anderson and began filming the scenes on Weathertop.[19] Mortensen became a hit with the crew by patching up his costume[20] and carrying his \"hero\" sword around with him off-camera.[8]\nBilly Boyd as Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took: a hobbit who travels with the Fellowship on their journey to Mordor.\nDominic Monaghan as Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck: a distant cousin of Frodo. Monaghan was cast as Merry after auditioning for Frodo.[13]\nJohn Rhys-Davies as Gimli: a dwarf warrior who accompanies the Fellowship to Mordor after they set out from Rivendell and a descendant of Durin's Folk. Billy Connolly, who was considered for the part of Gimli, later portrayed Dáin II Ironfoot in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy.[13] Rhys-Davies wore heavy prosthetics to play Gimli, which limited his vision, and eventually developed eczema around his eyes.[8]\nOrlando Bloom as Legolas Greenleaf: a prince of the elves' Woodland Realm and a skilled archer. Bloom initially auditioned for Faramir, who appears in the second film, a role which went to David Wenham.[13]\nSean Bean as Boromir: a prince of the Stewards of Gondor who journeys with the Fellowship towards Mordor. Bruce Willis, a fan of the book, expressed interest in the role, while Liam Neeson was sent the script, but passed.[13]\nIan Holm as Bilbo Baggins: Frodo's uncle who gives him the Ring after he decides to retire to Rivendell. Holm previously played Frodo in a 1981 radio adaption of The Lord of the Rings, and was cast as Bilbo after Jackson remembered his performance.[13] Sylvester McCoy, who would later play Radagast the Brown in The Hobbit, was contacted about playing the role, and was kept in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Holm.[21]\nLiv Tyler as Arwen Undomiel: a beautiful half-elf princess of Rivendell and Aragorn's lover. The filmmakers approached Tyler after seeing her performance in Plunkett & Macleane, and New Line Cinema leaped at the opportunity of having one Hollywood star in the film. Actress Helena Bonham Carter had expressed interest in the role.[13] Peter Jackson wanted to cast Uma Thurman as Arwen, but Thurman pulled out due to pregnancy, Tyler came to shoot on short occasions, unlike the rest of the actors. She was one of the last actors to be cast, on 25 August 1999.[22]\nCate Blanchett as Galadriel: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside her husband Celeborn. Peter Jackson wanted to cast Lucy Lawless as Galadriel, but she declined due to pregnancy.[23]\nChristopher Lee as Saruman the White: the fallen head of the Istari Order who succumbs to Sauron's will through his use of the palantír. Lee was a major fan of the book, and read it once a year. He had also met J. R. R. Tolkien.[19] He originally auditioned for Gandalf, but was judged too old.[13]\nHugo Weaving as Elrond: the elven Lord of Rivendell who leads the Council of Elrond, which ultimately decides to destroy the Ring. David Bowie expressed interest in the role, but Jackson stated, \"To have a famous, beloved character and a famous star colliding is slightly uncomfortable.\"[14]\nSala Baker as Sauron: the Dark Lord of Mordor and the Ring's true master who manifests as an Eye after the destruction of his physical form. Originally hired as one of the several stunt performers for the film trilogy, Baker ended up landing the role. In addition, he went on to play several Orcs as well.\nAndy Serkis as Gollum voice and motion capture: a wretched hobbit-like creature whose mind was poisoned over centuries by the Ring.\nDavid Weatherley as Barliman Butterbur, proprietor in Bree\nLawrence Makoare as Lurtz: the commander of Saruman's Orc forces;\nMarton Csokas as Celeborn: the elven co-ruler of Lothlórien alongside his wife Galadriel;\nCraig Parker as Haldir: the leader of the Galadhrim warriors guarding the border of Lothlórien;\nMark Ferguson as Ereinion Gil-galad, the last Elven-King of Noldor;\nPeter McKenzie as Elendil the Tall: the last High King of Arnor and Gondor;\nHarry Sinclair as Isildur: Elendil's son and Aragorn's ancestor who originally defeated Sauron.\nPeter Jackson as Albert Dreary: a man of Bree.\n\n\nQuestion: who played the hobbits in the lord of the rings\nAnswer:", "answer": "Elijah Wood", "aliases": ["Billy Boyd", "Billy Boyd as Peregrin \"Pippin\" Took", "Elijah Wood as Frodo Baggins", "Sean Astin", "Sean Astin as Samwise \"Sam\" Gamgee", "Dominic Monaghan", "Ian Holm", "Dominic Monaghan as Meriadoc \"Merry\" Brandybuck"]}

In July 1823, he was condemned to death for the 40-sous theft and the escape from the jail in Montreuil-sur-Mer, as the prosecutor claims that Valjean was part of a gang of street robbers and the latter refuses to defend himself. His sentence was graciously reduced by the king to only life in prison instead of death. Before he was captured, Jean Valjean had already traveled near to Montfermeil and buried all the money he'd saved as M.

Very few authorities continued using their own finances to support education for native Africans.[2] In 1959, this type of education was extended to \"non white\" universities and colleges with the Extension of University Education Act, and the internationally prestigious University College of Fort Hare was taken over by the government and degraded to being part of the Bantu education system.[3] It is often argued that the policy of Bantu (African) education was aimed to direct black or non-white youth to the unskilled labour market,[4] although Hendrik Verwoerd, at the time Minister of Native Affairs, claimed that the aim was to solve South Africa's \"ethnic problems\" by creating complementary economic and political units for different ethnic groups.\n\nQuestion: what was the purpose of the bantu education act\nAnswer:", "answer": "enforcing racially separated educational facilities", "aliases": ["legalised several aspects of the apartheid system"]}

{"context": "Context: The caps at both poles consist primarily of water ice. Frozen carbon dioxide accumulates as a comparatively thin layer about one metre thick on the north cap in the northern winter only, while the south cap has a permanent dry ice cover about 8 m thick.[4] The northern polar cap has a diameter of about 1000 km during the northern Mars summer,[5] and contains about 1.6 million cubic km of ice, which if spread evenly on the cap would be 2 km thick.[6] (This compares to a volume of 2.85 million cubic km (km3) for the Greenland ice sheet.) The southern polar cap has a diameter of 350 km and a thickness of 3 km.[7] The total volume of ice in the south polar cap plus the adjacent layered deposits has also been estimated at 1.6 million cubic km.[8] Both polar caps show spiral troughs, which recent analysis of SHARAD ice penetrating radar has shown are a result of roughly perpendicular katabatic winds that spiral due to the Coriolis Effect.[9][10]\nThe planet Mars has two permanent polar ice caps. During a pole's winter, it lies in continuous darkness, chilling the surface and causing the deposition of 25–30% of the atmosphere into slabs of CO2 ice (dry ice).[1] When the poles are again exposed to sunlight, the frozen CO2 sublimes, creating enormous winds that sweep off the poles as fast as 400 km/h.[2] These seasonal actions transport large amounts of dust and water vapor, giving rise to Earth-like frost and large cirrus clouds. Clouds of water-ice were photographed by the Opportunity rover in 2004.[3]\n\nQuestion: what is the snow on mars made of\nAnswer:", "answer": "water ice", "aliases": ["Frozen carbon dioxide", "CO2 ice (dry ice)"]}
{"context": "Context: Much of Elena's story revolves around her relationships with vampires Stefan Salvatore and his older brother, Damon. It is revealed that Elena is a Petrova Doppelgänger, which is thus responsible for her being identical to her ancestor, Katherine Pierce (née Katerina Petrova). This also has the implication of making her a supernatural creature. Dobrev portrayed the \"conniving\" Katherine as well, who is opposite of Elena. The actress stated that it has been a challenge distinguishing the two, and enjoys playing them both. In the television series's fourth season, Elena becomes a vampire and deals with the struggles that come with her change. She took the cure and became human again towards the end of the sixth season. In the finale of the sixth season, Kai linked Elena to Bonnie's life by magic. Elena will only wake up when Bonnie dies in around 60 years. She was locked inside the Salvatore tomb, which was changed in the seventh season, and was relocated in Brooklyn, New York. In late 2016, when it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season, Dobrev was in talks about returning to the television series to reprise her role in the final episode. After much speculation. Dobrev's return was confirmed on January 26, 2017, via an Instagram post. Dobrev appeared in the final episode of the show as both Elena and her evil doppelgänger Katherine Pierce.\nIn season four, Elena is faced with the tough decision of whether to die or to feed on human blood so she can fully transition into a vampire. Elena, after realizing Stefan's desperation to keep her alive, decides to complete her transition. Her relationship with Stefan ends, allowing her to begin a proper romance with Damon. Although, it is later revealed there is a sire bond between them. Sometime later whilst searching for the cure for vampirism, Jeremy is fed to the immortal Silas by Katherine. As a result, Damon used the sire bond to convince her to turn off her humanity, due to her incredible grief over losing her brother and the last remaining member of her family. Elena became ruthless without her emotions, going on killing sprees and being very hateful towards her friends. Towards the end of season four, Damon kills Matt in front of Elena to trigger her grief. After revealing that Matt had the Gilbert Ring on, Elena's humanity was switched on and her emotions were focused on hate towards Katherine for killing Jeremy. Season four ended with Bonnie as a ghost after bringing Jeremy back to life and Elena fed Katherine the cure for vampirism in a moment of desperation as she was about to be killed.

To amplify Eleven's powers, they break into the middle school and build a sensory-deprivation tank. Eleven finds Barb's corpse with a slug-like creature crawling out of her mouth. With Joyce's help, she finds Will alive, hiding in the Upside Down \"Castle Byers,\" his backyard fort. Hopper and Joyce break into Hawkins Laboratory but are apprehended by security guards.

In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain to play center, and after losing in the Finals in 1969 and 1970, they won their sixth NBA title—and first in Los Angeles—in 1972, led by new head coach Bill Sharman.

This team featured Hall of Famers in Johnson, Abdul-Jabbar, and James Worthy, and a Hall of Fame coach, Pat Riley. After Abdul-Jabbar and Johnson's retirement, the team struggled in the early 1990s before acquiring Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in 1996.

{"context": "Context: Principal photography began on October 6, 1975 in Lake Powell.[9][8] A rift between Eastwood and Kaufman developed during the filming. Kaufman insisted on filming with a meticulous attention to detail, which caused disagreements with Eastwood, not to mention the attraction the two shared towards Locke and apparent jealousy on Kaufman's part in regards to their emerging relationship.[10] One evening, Kaufman insisted on finding a beer can as a prop to be used in a scene, but while he was absent, Eastwood ordered Surtees to quickly shoot the scene as light was fading and then drove away, leaving before Kaufman had returned.[11] Soon after, filming moved to Kanab, Utah. On October 24, 1975, Kaufman was fired at Eastwood's command by producer Bob Daley.[12] The sacking caused an outrage amongst the Directors Guild of America and other important Hollywood executives, since the director had already worked hard on the film, including completing all of the pre-production.[12] Pressure mounted on Warner Bros. and Eastwood to back down, but their refusal to do so resulted in a fine, reported to be around $60,000 for the violation.[12] This resulted in the Director's Guild passing new legislation, known as 'the Eastwood Rule', which prohibits an actor or producer from firing the director and then becoming the director himself.[12] From then on, the film was directed by Eastwood himself with Daley second-in-command, but with Kaufman's planning already in place, the team were able to finish making the film efficiently.\nCinematographer Bruce Surtees, James Fargo, and Fritz Manes scouted for locations and eventually found sites in Utah, Arizona, Wyoming, and Oroville, California even before they saw the final script.[7] Kaufman cast Chief Dan George, who had been nominated for an Academy Award for Supporting Actor in Little Big Man, as the old Cherokee Lone Watie. Sondra Locke, also a previous Academy Award nominee, was cast by Eastwood against Kaufman's wishes[8] as the granddaughter of the old settler woman, Laura Lee. This marked the beginning of a close relationship between Eastwood and Locke that would last six films and the beginning of a romance that would last into the late 1980s. Ferris Webster was hired as the film's editor and Jerry Fielding as composer.\n\nQuestion: where was the outlaw of josey wales filmed\nAnswer:", "answer": "Wyoming", "aliases": ["Utah", "Oroville, California", "Lake Powell", "Kanab, Utah", "Arizona"]}

{"context": "Context: Blond hair can have almost any proportion of pheomelanin and eumelanin, but has only small amounts of both. More pheomelanin creates a more golden or strawberry blond color, and more eumelanin creates an ash or sandy blond color.

Pregnancy hormones hasten this process. Natural light blond hair is rare in adulthood, with claims of the world's population ranging from 2% naturally blond[3][self-published source] to 16% in the US.[4] Blond hair is most commonly found in Northern and Western Europeans and their descendants but can be found spread around most of Europe.

{"context": "Context: The Roman Catholic holy day of All Saints (or All Hallows) was introduced in the year 609, but was originally celebrated on 13 May.[83] In 835, Louis the Pious switched it to 1 November in the Carolingian Empire, at the behest of Pope Gregory IV.[83] However, from the testimony of Pseudo-Bede, it is known that churches in what are now England and Germany were already celebrating All Saints on 1 November at the beginning of the 8th century.[83][84][85] Thus, Louis merely made official the custom of celebrating it on 1 November. James Frazer suggests that 1 November was chosen because it was the date of the Celtic festival of the dead (Samhain) – the Celts had influenced their English neighbours, and English missionaries had influenced the Germans. However, Ronald Hutton points out that, according to Óengus of Tallaght (d. ca. 824), the 7th/8th century church in Ireland celebrated All Saints on 20 April. He suggests that the 1 November date was a Germanic rather than a Celtic idea.[83] In the 11th century, 2 November became established as All Souls' Day. This created the three-day observance known as Allhallowtide: All Hallows' Eve (31 October), All Hallows' Day (1 November), and All Souls' Day (2 November).\n\nQuestion: the christian church used which holiday to take attention away from samhain\nAnswer:", "answer": "All Saints (or All Hallows)", "aliases": []}

He crudely disguises himself as Santa Claus, and forces Max, disguised as a reindeer, to drag a sleigh down the mountain towards Whoville. Once at Whoville, the Grinch slides down the chimney of one house and steals all of the Whos' Christmas presents, the Christmas tree, and the log for their fire. He is briefly interrupted in his burglary by Cindy Lou, a little Who girl, but concocts a crafty lie to effect his escape from her home. After stealing from one house, he does the same thing to all the other houses in the village of Whoville.\n\nQuestion: dogs name in the grinch who stole christmas\nAnswer:", "answer": "Max", "aliases": []}

{"context": "Context: The NFL Scouting Combine is a six-day assessment of skills occurring every year in late February or early March in Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana. College football players perform physical and mental tests in front of NFL coaches, general managers, and scouts. With increasing interest in the NFL draft, the scouting combine has grown in scope and significance, allowing personnel directors to evaluate upcoming prospects in a standardized setting. Its origins have evolved from the National, BLESTO, and Quadra Scouting services in 1977 to the media frenzy it has become today. Athletes attend by invitation only. Implications of one's performance during the Combine can affect perception, draft status, salary, and ultimately his career. The draft has popularized the term \"Workout Warrior\" (sometimes known as a \"Workout Wonder\"), describing an athlete who, based on superior measurables such as size, speed, and strength, has increased his \"draft stock\" despite having a possibly average or subpar college career.[70][71][72]\nThe National Football League Draft, also called the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event in which it serves as the league's most common source of player recruitment. The basic design of the draft is that each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade their position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its draft position. Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have seen revisions since its first creation in 1936, but the fundamental methodology has remained the same. Currently the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, have chosen the best player available.\n\nQuestion: who picks the players in the nfl draft\nAnswer:", "answer": "each team", "aliases": ["NFL coaches, general managers, and scouts"]}
{"context": "Context: The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was found by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill in Coloma, California.[1] The news of gold brought some 300,000 people to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.[2] The sudden influx of immigration and gold into the money supply reinvigorated the American economy, and California became one of the few American states to go directly to statehood without first being a territory, in the Compromise of 1850. The Gold Rush had severe effects on Native Californians and resulted in a precipitous population decline from disease, genocide and starvation.

Each country's having different policies and priorities has resulted in a variety of differences existing between the systems.[27][28] That said, each country provides public healthcare to all UK permanent residents that is free at the point of use, being paid for from general taxation.\nSingle-payer healthcare is a healthcare system financed by taxes that covers the costs of essential healthcare for all residents, with costs covered by a single public system (hence 'single-payer').
