{"context": "Q: Passage: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar.\nWhich one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends?\n:\n(A)) Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks.\n(B)) A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life.\n(C)) During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned.\n(D)) A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(D)"}

{"context": "Q: Passage: Theoretically, analog systems are superior to digital systems. A signal in a pure analog system can be infinitely detailed, while digital systems cannot produce signals that are more precise than their digital units. With this theoretical advantage there is a practical disadvantage, however. Since there is no limit on the potential detail of the signal, the duplication of an analog representation allows tiny variations from the original, which are errors. These errors tend to accumulate as signals are duplicated, until this \"noise\" obliterates the information embodied in the original signal.\nThe statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following?\n:\n(A)) Analog representation of information is impractical because we do not need infinitely detailed information.\n(B)) Digital systems are preferable to analog systems when the signal must be reproduced many times.\n(C)) Many ideas that work well in theory do not work well in practice.\n(D)) Analog systems are inferior to digital systems for most practical purposes.\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(B)"}

From these examples, it is clear that if you wait long enough, almost any food will be reported to be healthful.\nThe reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument\n:\n(A)) bases an overly broad generalization on just a few instances\n(B)) fails to consider that there are many foods that are reported to be unhealthful\n(C)) takes for granted that all results of nutritional research are eventually reported\n(D)) relies on the truth of a claim by a source that is likely to be biased\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(A)"}
{"context": "Q: Passage: According to the \"bottom-up\" theory of how ecosystems are structured, the availability of edible plants is what primarily determines an ecosystem's characteristics since it determines how many herbivores the ecosystem can support, which in turn determines how many predators it can support. This theory also holds that a reduction in the number of predators will have little impact on the rest of the ecosystem.\nWhich one of the following, if true, would provide evidence against the bottom-up theory?\n:\n(A)) After hunting virtually eliminated predators on Rigu Island, the population of many herbivore species increased more than tenfold, causing the density of plants to be dramatically reduced.\n(B)) In an effort to build up the population of a rare species of monkey on Vahique Island, monkeys were bred in zoos and released into the wild. However, the effort failed because the trees on which the monkeys fed were also nearly extinct.\n(C)) After a new species of fern was introduced to Lisdok Island, native ferns were almost eliminated. However, this did not affect the population of the herbivores that had eaten the native ferns, since they also thrived on a diet of the new fern.\n(D)) Plants that are a dietary staple of wild pigs on Sedif Island have flourished over the last three decades, and the population of the pigs has not changed much in spite of extensive hunting.\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(A)"}

Although the computer was typically used in the operation of the company's business, the particular files accessed by the police officer were personal letters written by one of the company's employees. Thus, the police officer's unauthorized use of the computer was not justified.\n(B)) Police department investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of the central computer owned by a consulting firm that was on trial for fraudulent business practices without seeking permission from the firm's owners. Contrary to the investigators' reasonable beliefs, however, the files ultimately provided no evidence of wrongdoing.

Since the police officer's search of the files on Natalie's computer produced no evidence usable in any legal proceeding against Natalie, the police officer's action was clearly not justified.\n(D)) Rey gave his friend Sunok a key to the store where he worked and asked her to use the store owners' computer to look up their friend Jim's phone number, which Rey kept on the computer. Because Sunok had Rey's permission, her action was justified.\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(B)"}
{"context": "Q: Passage: The conventional process for tanning leather uses large amounts of calcium oxide and sodium sulfide. Tanning leather using biological catalysts costs about the same as using these conventional chemicals if the cost of waste disposal is left out of the comparison. However, nearly 20 percent less waste is produced with biological catalysts, and waste disposal is a substantial part of the overall cost of tanning. It is therefore less costly to tan leather if biological catalysts are used instead.\nWhich one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?\n:\n(A)) The biological catalysts that can be used in the tanning process are less costly by weight than are calcium oxide and sodium sulfide.\n(B)) Leather tanned using the conventional process is not lower in quality than is leather tanned using biological catalysts.\n(C)) The labor costs associated with tanning leather using biological catalysts are not any greater than the labor costs associated with the conventional tanning process.\n(D)) Disposal of tanning waste produced with biological catalysts does not cost significantly more than disposal of the same amount of waste produced with the conventional process.\nAnswer:\nA:", "answer": "(D)"}

{"context": "Q: Passage: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music.\nWhich one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer?\n:\n(A)) For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances.\n(B)) We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains.\n(C)) We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances.\n(D)) We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them.

However, since the impatiens in my garden are still in bloom today, temperatures did not drop below freezing last week.\nThe pattern of reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely parallels that in the argument above?\n:\n(A)) If a species is introduced into a new environment, it adversely affects some species already existing in that environment, but only if it adapts well to it. Therefore, if a species does not adapt well to a new environment, it will not adversely affect any species already existing in it.\n(B)) If the introduction of a new species would adversely affect some species already existing in an environment, that species should not be introduced into it. Therefore, since the introduction of species into new environments will result in some species in those environments being adversely affected, species should probably not be introduced into new environments.\n(C)) If a species is highly adaptable, it will thrive when introduced into a new environment. If a species thrives in its new environment, it will have an adverse effect on species already existing in that environment.

So Theresa probably approves of the prime minister's overall job performance.\nWhich one of the following arguments exhibits flawed reasoning that is most parallel to that in the argument above?\n:\n(A)) Of the people who believe that the overall economy has improved, most believe it because they believe that their own financial situation has improved. Chung believes that the economy has worsened, so he probably believes that his own financial situation has worsened.\n(B)) Of the people who oppose funding a study to determine the feasibility of building a light rail line in the Loffoch Valley, most also believe that the Valley Freeway should be built. Donna opposes increasing funding for a study, so she probably supports building the Valley Freeway.\n(C)) Of the people who expect the population in the area to increase over the next ten years, most think that an expected population increase is a good reason to build a new school. Bonita does not expect the population to increase over the next ten years, so she probably does not favor building a new school.\n(D)) Of the people who support allowing limited logging in the Grizzly National Forest, most support it because they think it will reduce the risk of fire in the forest.
